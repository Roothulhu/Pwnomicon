<summary><h1>üì¢ Introduction</h1></summary>

Vulnerabilities are often discovered by individuals who deeply understand a technology, protocol, or service. As we progress in this field, we will encounter a variety of services to interact with, requiring us to **continuously adapt and learn new technologies**.

To successfully attack a service, we must understand **its purpose, how to interact with it, which tools are available, and the potential actions we can perform**.

This section will explore **common services** and demonstrate practical ways to interact with them effectively.

<details>
<summary><h3>File Share Services</h3></summary>

A file-sharing service is a system that facilitates, manages, and monitors the transfer of computer files. Historically, organizations relied primarily on internal file-sharing protocols such as **SMB**, **NFS**, **FTP**, **TFTP**, and **SFTP**. However, with the widespread adoption of cloud technologies, many companies now also use **third-party cloud-based** solutions like **Dropbox**, **Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, **SharePoint**, and cloud storage services such as **AWS S3**, **Azure Blob Storage**, and **Google Cloud Storage**.

In practice, we will often encounter a hybrid environment where both internal and external file-sharing systems are in use. For example, a server may host internal SMB shares while also synchronizing data with cloud storage.

This section will focus primarily on **internal file-sharing services**, although the same principles can apply to cloud storage solutions that are synced locally to servers and workstations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Server Message Block (SMB)</h3></summary>

**SMB** is a network file-sharing protocol most commonly used in **Windows environments**. It enables users and applications to read, write, and manage files on remote servers as if they were local. In a Windows network, it is common to find **shared folders** accessible over SMB, often used for collaboration or centralized file storage.

We can interact with SMB shares through:
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** ‚Äì e.g., Windows File Explorer.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** ‚Äì e.g., `net use`, `dir`, or PowerShell commands in Windows; `smbclient` in Linux.
* **Specialized tools** ‚Äì e.g., Impacket scripts, CrackMapExec, enum4linux.

The following sections will outline common methods for accessing and interacting with SMB from both Windows and Linux systems.

<details>
<summary><h3>Windows</h3></summary>

<details>
<summary><h4>GUI Method</h4></summary>

**Step 1: Open the Run Dialog Box**

Press `WINKEY` + `R` on your keyboard.

**Step 2: Enter the SMB Share Path**

In the Run dialog box, type the file share location in the following format:

```cmd
\\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>
```

**Step 3: Authenticate if required**

If prompted, enter valid username and password credentials for the remote system.

**Step 4: Browse the Share**

Once connected, you can view, copy, edit, or delete files according to your permissions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Windows CMD - DIR</h4></summary>

The command dir displays a list of a directory's files and subdirectories.

**Run the `dir` command on the share**

```cmd
dir  \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>
```

**Example Output:**

```cmd
C:\tom> dir \\192.168.220.129\Finance\

Volume in drive \\192.168.220.129\Finance has no label.
Volume Serial Number is ABCD-EFAA

Directory of \\192.168.220.129\Finance

02/23/2022  11:35 AM    <DIR>          Contracts
               0 File(s)          4,096 bytes
               1 Dir(s)  15,207,469,056 bytes free
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Windows CMD - Net Use</h4></summary>


**OPTION 1 > Step 1: Use `net use` to connect to the share**

```cmd
net use n: \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>
```

**OPTION 2 > Step 1: Use `net use` and provide a username and password to authenticate to the share**

```cmd
net use n: \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME> /user:<USER> <PASSWORD>
```

With the shared folder mapped as the `n` drive, we can execute Windows commands as if this shared folder is on our local computer. Let's find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.

**Step 2: Find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.**

```cmd
dir n: /a-d /s /b | find /c ":\"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Windows PowerShell - Get-ChildItem</h4></summary>

**Run the `Get-ChildItem` command on the share**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>
```

**Example Output:**

```powershell
# PS C:\tom> Get-ChildItem \\192.168.220.129\Finance\

#     Directory: \\192.168.220.129\Finance

# Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
# ----                 -------------         ------ ----
# d-----         2/23/2022   3:27 PM                Contracts
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Windows PowerShell - New-PSDrive</h4></summary>

**OPTION 1 > Step 1: Map the shared folder to a drive letter using `New-PSDrive`**

```powershell
New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>" -PSProvider "FileSystem"
```

**OPTION 2 > Step 1: Provide a username and password with Powershell to map the shared folder to a drive letter using `New-PSDrive`**

```powershell
$username = '<USER>'
$password = '<PASWORD>'
$secpassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $secpassword
New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Credential $cred
```

**Example Output:**

```powershell
# Name           Used (GB)     Free (GB) Provider      Root                                               CurrentLocation
# ----           ---------     --------- --------      ----                                               ---------------
# N                                      FileSystem    \\192.168.220.129\Finance
```

**Step 2: Find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.**

```powershell
N:
(Get-ChildItem -File -Recurse | Measure-Object).Count
```

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Linux</h3></summary>

Linux (UNIX) machines can also browse and mount SMB shares. This works whether the target server is a **Windows machine** or a **Samba server**. While some Linux distributions include GUI support, we will focus on using **command-line utilities** and tools to interact with SMB.

> **NOTE:** We need to install `cifs-utils` to connect to an SMB share folder. To install it we can execute from the command line `sudo apt install cifs-utils`.

<details>
<summary><h4>Linux - Mount</h4></summary>

**OPTION 1 > Step 1: Mount an SMB share to interact with its directories and files locally**

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/<SHARE_NAME>
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=<USER>,password=<PASWORD>,domain=. \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>
```

**OPTION 1 > Step 2: Use a credential file to mount an SMB share to interact with its directories and files locally**

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/<SHARE_NAME>
sudo mount -t cifs \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME> /mnt/<SHARE_NAME> -o credentials=./credential_file.txt
```

The file `credential_file.txt` has to be structured like this:

```txt
username=plaintext
password=Password123
domain=.
```

<summary><h3>General Troubleshooting</h3></summary>

Depending on the **Windows** or **Linux** version we are working with or targeting, we may face various challenges when trying to connect to a service.

Common reasons for **lack of access** to a resource include:

* Authentication issues
* Insufficient privileges
* Network connectivity problems
* Firewall restrictions
* Unsupported protocols

Errors may vary depending on the specific service targeted. It‚Äôs important to leverage these **error codes** by consulting official documentation or community forums, where solutions to similar problems can often be found.

<summary><h1>üéØ Protocol Specific Attacks</h1></summary>

<details>
<summary><h2>The Concept of Attacks</h2></summary>

To effectively understand attacks on different services, we need to examine **how these services can be targeted**. A concept is a general plan or framework applied across various projects. For example, consider the concept of building a house: most houses have a basement, four walls, and a roof. While the specific materials or designs may vary, the basic structure remains consistent worldwide. This illustrates that a concept requires general categories‚Äîlike floors, walls, and roof‚Äîthat provide a flexible but unified framework.

In our context, we need to develop a concept for attacking various services by grouping them into categories that summarize all services while still allowing for individual attack methods.

To clarify, we can try grouping services like **SSH**, **FTP**, **SMB**, and **HTTP** and identify what they have in common. From there, we can build a structure or pattern that helps us pinpoint attack vectors across these services using a single, unified approach.

This process of analyzing commonalities and creating adaptable attack pattern templates is ongoing‚Äîit‚Äôs not a finished product but an evolving framework that grows and improves over time.

The concept is structured around four categories that appear in every vulnerability:

<details>
<summary><h3>1. Source</h3></summary>

We can generalize **Source** as the origin of information used by a process to perform a specific task. Information can be passed to a process in many different ways.

| Information Source | Description                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code               | The results of already executed program code used as a source of information. These can come from different functions of a program. |
| Libraries          | A collection of program resources, including configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, prebuilt code and subroutines, classes, values, or type specifications. |
| Config             | Usually static or prescribed values that determine how the process handles information.                              |
| APIs               | Application Programming Interfaces used as program interfaces for retrieving or providing information.               |
| User Input         | Manual entry of information by a person, when a program allows user input to process data accordingly.               |

The Source is the origin exploited to trigger vulnerabilities. The specific protocol used is irrelevant‚Äîfor example, HTTP header injections can be manipulated manually, just like buffer overflows.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>2. Process</h3></summary>

The **Process** refers to how information received from the Source is handled. This processing is carried out according to the task defined by the program code. For each task, developers specify how information should be processed‚Äîusing classes, functions, calculations, loops, and more. Since development approaches vary widely, the possibilities are nearly endless. Consequently, most vulnerabilities stem from flaws in the program code executed during this process.

| Process Components | Description                                                                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PID                | The Process ID (PID) identifies the process being started or already running. Running processes have assigned privileges, and new ones are started accordingly. |
| Input              | Refers to information input assigned either by a user or resulting from a programmed function.                       |
| Data processing    | The hard-coded functions of a program that dictate how the received information is processed.                         |
| Variables          | Placeholders for information that different functions can further process during the task.                           |
| Logging            | The documentation of certain events, often stored in a register or file, meaning some information remains in the system. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>3. Privileges</h3></summary>

**Privileges** exist in all systems that manage processes. They act like permissions that determine which tasks and actions can be performed. Simply put, privileges are like a bus ticket: if you have a ticket for a specific region, you can ride the bus; if not, you cannot.

Similarly, privileges (or ‚Äútickets‚Äù) can apply to various modes of transport‚Äîplanes, trains, boats, and so on. In computer systems, privileges control and segment actions, requiring different permissions that the system enforces.

When a process attempts to perform a task, the system checks if it has the necessary privileges. If the required permissions and conditions are met, the system approves the requested action.

| Privileges | Description                                                                                                          |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System     | These are the highest privileges allowing any system modification. In Windows, this is called SYSTEM; in Linux, root. |
| User       | Permissions assigned to a specific user. For security, Linux often creates separate users for specific services.     |
| Groups     | Categorization of users who share certain permissions to perform specific actions.                                    |
| Policies   | Determine execution of application-specific commands, applying to individual or grouped users and their actions.      |
| Rules      | Permissions to perform actions managed within the applications themselves.                                           |

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>4. Destination</h3></summary>

Every task has at least one purpose or goal that must be fulfilled. If data changes were neither stored nor forwarded, the task would generally be unnecessary. The outcome of a task is either stored locally or forwarded to another processing point.

This endpoint is called the **Destination**, where the data changes occur. Destinations can be either local or remote processes. At the local level, files or records may be modified, or data may be forwarded to other local services for further use. However, the same process may also reuse the resulting data.

Once the data is stored or forwarded, the cycle of the task is complete.

| Destination | Description                                                                                                               |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local       | The local area refers to the system environment where the process occurred. Results are either further processed or stored locally. |
| Network     | The network area involves forwarding process results to a remote interface, such as an IP address, its services, or entire networks. Under some circumstances, these results can also influence routing. |

</details>

> **NOTE:** While these categories are consistent across services, the specific details within each may vary depending on the service.

We now have a repeatable pattern template that can be applied to attacks. This template helps analyze and understand exploits, and it is useful for debugging our own exploits during development and testing. Additionally, it can be applied to source code analysis, enabling step-by-step review of specific functionalities and commands. Lastly, this approach allows us to evaluate the risks associated with each task individually.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Service Misconfigurations</h2></summary>

Misconfigurations occur when system administrators, technical support, or developers incorrectly set up the security framework of an application, website, desktop, or server. This often creates vulnerable pathways that unauthorized users can exploit.

<details>
<summary><h3>Authentication</h3></summary>

In previous years‚Äîand occasionally even today during assessments‚Äîit was common for services to come with default credentials (username and password). This poses a significant security risk because many administrators fail to change these defaults.

Nowadays, most software requires users to set up credentials during installation, which is an improvement. However, default credentials can still be found, especially in older applications.

Even if there are no default credentials, administrators might use weak or no passwords initially, intending to change them later, which creates vulnerabilities.

To prevent this, administrators should define and enforce strong password policies for all software deployed or tested within their environment.

<details>
<summary><h4>Anonymous Authentication</h4></summary>

Another common misconfiguration is **anonymous authentication**. When enabled, the service allows anyone with network access to connect without requiring credentials, creating a serious security risk.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Misconfigured Access Rights</h4></summary>

**Misconfigured access rights** occur when user accounts are granted incorrect permissions. A significant risk arises when individuals lower in the organizational hierarchy gain access to sensitive information intended only for managers or administrators.

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Unnecessary Defaults</h3></summary>

The initial configuration of devices and software often includes default settings, features, files, and credentials. These defaults are usually designed for ease of use rather than security. Leaving these defaults unchanged is a poor security practice, especially in production environments. Unnecessary default settings should be modified to reduce the system‚Äôs attack surface.

Accepting default settings during setup can expose sensitive company information. Attackers may exploit default credentials or weak settings with minimal effort, sometimes just by a quick internet search.

**[Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)** is listed in the **[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/)**. Common issues related to default values include:
* Unnecessary features enabled or installed (e.g., open ports, unused services, default pages, accounts, or privileges).
* Default accounts and passwords remain enabled and unchanged.
* Error handling exposes stack traces or overly detailed error messages to users.
* On upgraded systems, new security features are disabled or improperly configured.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Preventing Misconfiguration</h3></summary>

Once we understand our environment, the most effective way to control risk is to lock down critical infrastructure and allow only necessary behaviors. Any communication or service not required by the application should be disabled. Examples include:

* Disabling admin interfaces when not in use.
* Turning off debugging features.
* Disabling default usernames and passwords.
* Configuring servers to prevent unauthorized access, directory listing, and related issues.
* Running regular scans and audits to detect misconfigurations or missing patches.

The **OWASP Top 10** includes guidance on securing installation processes, emphasizing the importance of a repeatable hardening process:

* Use a consistent hardening procedure to quickly and easily deploy secure environments.
* Configure development, QA, and production environments identically but with different credentials per environment.
* Automate this process to minimize setup effort and errors.

Other best practices include:

* Maintain a minimal platform by removing or not installing unnecessary features, components, documentation, and sample code.
* Regularly review and update configurations to apply security notes, updates, and patches (see A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components). Also, review cloud storage permissions, such as S3 bucket policies.
* Implement a segmented application architecture to enforce secure separation between components or tenants via segmentation, containerization, or cloud security groups (ACLs).
* Send security directives to clients, such as appropriate security headers.
* Automate verification processes to ensure configuration effectiveness across all environments.
