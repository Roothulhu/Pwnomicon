<summary><h1>üì¢ Introduction</h1></summary>

Vulnerabilities are often discovered by individuals who deeply understand a technology, protocol, or service. As we progress in this field, we will encounter a variety of services to interact with, requiring us to **continuously adapt and learn new technologies**.

To successfully attack a service, we must understand **its purpose, how to interact with it, which tools are available, and the potential actions we can perform**.

This section will explore **common services** and demonstrate practical ways to interact with them effectively.

<details>
<summary><h2>Interacting with Common Services</h2></summary>

<details>
<summary><h3>File Share Services</h3></summary>

A file-sharing service is a system that facilitates, manages, and monitors the transfer of computer files. Historically, organizations relied primarily on internal file-sharing protocols such as **SMB**, **NFS**, **FTP**, **TFTP**, and **SFTP**. However, with the widespread adoption of cloud technologies, many companies now also use **third-party cloud-based** solutions like **Dropbox**, **Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, **SharePoint**, and cloud storage services such as **AWS S3**, **Azure Blob Storage**, and **Google Cloud Storage**.

In practice, we will often encounter a hybrid environment where both internal and external file-sharing systems are in use. For example, a server may host internal SMB shares while also synchronizing data with cloud storage.

This section will focus primarily on **internal file-sharing services**, although the same principles can apply to cloud storage solutions that are synced locally to servers and workstations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Server Message Block (SMB)</h3></summary>

**SMB** is a network file-sharing protocol most commonly used in **Windows environments**. It enables users and applications to read, write, and manage files on remote servers as if they were local. In a Windows network, it is common to find **shared folders** accessible over SMB, often used for collaboration or centralized file storage.

We can interact with SMB shares through:
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** ‚Äì e.g., Windows File Explorer.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** ‚Äì e.g., `net use`, `dir`, or PowerShell commands in Windows; `smbclient` in Linux.
* **Specialized tools** ‚Äì e.g., Impacket scripts, CrackMapExec, enum4linux.

The following sections will outline common methods for accessing and interacting with SMB from both Windows and Linux systems.

<details>
<summary><h3>Windows</h3></summary>

<details>
<summary><h4>GUI Method</h4></summary>

**Step 1: Open the Run Dialog Box**

Press `WINKEY` + `R` on your keyboard.

**Step 2: Enter the SMB Share Path**

In the Run dialog box, type the file share location in the following format:

```cmd
\\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>
```

**Step 3: Authenticate if required**

If prompted, enter valid username and password credentials for the remote system.

**Step 4: Browse the Share**

Once connected, you can view, copy, edit, or delete files according to your permissions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Windows CMD - DIR</h4></summary>

The command dir displays a list of a directory's files and subdirectories.

**Run the `dir` command on the share**

```cmd
dir  \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>
```

**Example Output:**

```cmd
C:\tom> dir \\192.168.220.129\Finance\

Volume in drive \\192.168.220.129\Finance has no label.
Volume Serial Number is ABCD-EFAA

Directory of \\192.168.220.129\Finance

02/23/2022  11:35 AM    <DIR>          Contracts
               0 File(s)          4,096 bytes
               1 Dir(s)  15,207,469,056 bytes free
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Windows CMD - Net Use</h4></summary>


**OPTION 1 > Step 1: Use `net use` to connect to the share**

```cmd
net use n: \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>
```

**OPTION 2 > Step 1: Use `net use` and provide a username and password to authenticate to the share**

```cmd
net use n: \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME> /user:<USER> <PASSWORD>
```

With the shared folder mapped as the `n` drive, we can execute Windows commands as if this shared folder is on our local computer. Let's find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.

**Step 2: Find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.**

```cmd
dir n: /a-d /s /b | find /c ":\"
```

You can refer to the [GENERAL](./00-general.md) module to find different ways to explore and list files.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Windows PowerShell - Get-ChildItem</h4></summary>

**Run the `Get-ChildItem` command on the share**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem \\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>
```

**Example Output:**

```powershell
# PS C:\tom> Get-ChildItem \\192.168.220.129\Finance\

#     Directory: \\192.168.220.129\Finance

# Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
# ----                 -------------         ------ ----
# d-----         2/23/2022   3:27 PM                Contracts
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Windows PowerShell - New-PSDrive</h4></summary>

**OPTION 1 > Step 1: Map the shared folder to a drive letter using `New-PSDrive`**

```powershell
New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>" -PSProvider "FileSystem"
```

**OPTION 2 > Step 1: Provide a username and password with Powershell to map the shared folder to a drive letter using `New-PSDrive`**

```powershell
$username = '<USER>'
$password = '<PASWORD>'
$secpassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $secpassword
New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\<IP>\<SHARE_NAME>" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Credential $cred
```

**Example Output:**

```powershell
# Name           Used (GB)     Free (GB) Provider      Root                                               CurrentLocation
# ----           ---------     --------- --------      ----                                               ---------------
# N                                      FileSystem    \\192.168.220.129\Finance
```

**Step 2: Find how many files the shared folder and its subdirectories contain.**

```powershell
N:
(Get-ChildItem -File -Recurse | Measure-Object).Count
```
