# 🕷️ Metasploit Framework  
*Within this eldritch grimoire lies a vast arsenal of arcane tools for network divination, weaving attacks, and unraveling the deepest secrets of target systems. Harness its dark power to evade the watchful eyes, ascend to forbidden privileges, and command dominion after the breach.*

> *“To command the shadows is to master the unseen forces that bind the network.”*

Advices:

> *Do not get tunnel vision. Use the tool as a tool, not as a backbone or life support for our complete assessment.*

> *Please read all the technical documentation you can find for any of our tools.*

> *Many tools can prove to be unpredictable. Some can leave traces of activity on the target system, and some may leave our attacker platform with open gates.*
